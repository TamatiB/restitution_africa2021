0,Benin Bronzes: Germany to return looted artefacts to Nigeria ...,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56949003,"Benin Bronzes: Germany to return looted artefacts to Nigeria
- Published
Germany has agreed to return to Nigeria priceless artefacts that were stolen during the colonisation of Africa.
British troops looted thousands of artworks known as the Benin Bronzes from the Kingdom of Benin, in present-day Nigeria, in 1897.
Following auctions, some of the bronzes ended up in museums and private collections across Europe.
They hold deep cultural significance, and there is growing international pressure to give them back.
Berlin's Ethnologisches Museum holds more than 500 artefacts from the Kingdom of Benin, most of them bronzes.
""We want to contribute to understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen during colonisation,"" German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters said on Thursday, adding that the first returns were expected to take place in 2022.
Scotland's University of Aberdeen said last month it would repatriate a Benin bronze whose acquisition in 1957 at an auction it called ""extremely immoral"".
Last year, France approved the restitution of its collection of pillaged Benin Bronzes.
Hundreds of pieces are still held in the British Museum and several museums in the United States.
There are plans to house the returned artefacts in the forthcoming Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA). The project is a joint effort between the Nigeria-based Legacy Restoration Trust, the British Museum and architecture firm Adjaye Associates.
The Benin Bronzes - thousands of brass, bronze and ivory sculptures and carvings - have become highly charged symbols of colonialism and .
More than 900 of these artefacts are housed in the British Museum, which has come under increasing pressure to return them in the wake of last year's Black Lives Matter protests.
The British Museum has told the BBC that it is ""committed to facilitating a permanent display of Benin material"" in Edo, but has not specified how many items would be returned, adding ""the selection of objects will be determined through discussion with our Nigerian colleagues"".
Historians say Benin City, formerly known as Edo, boasted earthen walls longer than the Great Wall of China.
It was also said to be one of the first cities with a form of street lighting.
British troops razed the whole city to the ground in 1897 to avenge the killing of an earlier force.",2021-04-30,2021-04-30,benin bronze germany return loot artefact nigeria publish germany agree return nigeria priceless artefact steal colonisation africa british troop loot thousand artwork know benin bronze kingdom benin present day nigeria 1897 follow auction bronze end museum private collection across europe hold deep cultural significance grow international pressure give back berlin ethnologisches museum hold 500 artefact kingdom benin bronze we want contribute understand reconciliation descendant whose cultural treasure steal colonisation german culture minister monika gruetters say thursday add first return expect take place 2022 scotland university aberdeen say last month would repatriate benin bronze whose acquisition 1957 auction call extremely immoral last year france approve restitution collection pillage benin bronze hundred piece still held british museum several museum united state plan house return artefact forthcoming edo museum west african art emowaa project joint effort nigeria base legacy restoration trust british museum architecture firm adjaye associate benin bronze thousand brass bronze ivory sculpture carving become highly charge symbol colonialism 900 artefact house british museum come increase pressure return wake last year black life matter protest british museum told bbc commit facilitate permanent display benin material edo specify many item would return add the selection object determine discussion nigerian colleague historian say benin city formerly know edo boast earthen wall longer great wall china also say one first city form street light british troop raze whole city ground 1897 avenge kill earlier force,benin bronz germani return loot artefact nigeria publish germani agre return nigeria priceless artefact stolen colonis africa british troop loot thousand artwork known benin bronz kingdom benin present day nigeria 1897 follow auction bronz end museum privat collect across europ hold deep cultur signific grow intern pressur give back berlin ethnologisch museum hold 500 artefact kingdom benin bronz we want contribut understand reconcili descend whose cultur treasur stolen colonis german cultur minist monika gruetter said thursday ad first return expect take place 2022 scotland univers aberdeen said last month would repatri benin bronz whose acquisit 1957 auction call extrem immor last year franc approv restitut collect pillag benin bronz hundr piec still held british museum sever museum unit state plan hous return artefact forthcom edo museum west african art emowaa project joint effort nigeria base legaci restor trust british museum architectur firm adjay associ benin bronz thousand brass bronz ivori sculptur carv becom highli charg symbol coloni 900 artefact hous british museum come increas pressur return wake last year black live matter protest british museum told bbc commit facilit perman display benin materi edo specifi mani item would return ad the select object determin discuss nigerian colleagu historian say benin citi formerli known edo boast earthen wall longer great wall china also said one first citi form street light british troop raze whole citi ground 1897 aveng kill earlier forc

2,Nigeria welcomes Germany′s decision to return looted Benin ...,https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-welcomes-germanys-decision-to-return-looted-benin-bronzes/a-57382591,"German cultural and political leaders have reached a deal to return the artefacts to Nigeria next year. The ancient artworks were plundered in the 19th century and are currently on display in German museums.
Most of the artefacts were looted by British forces during a military expedition to the kingdom, in what is now Nigeria, in 1897
Germany plans to hand back ancient, pillaged artefacts known as the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria next year, after museum experts and political leaders struck an agreement on Thursday.
Most of the artefacts were looted by British forces during a military expedition to the kingdom, in what is now Nigeria, in 1897.
The 16th-18th century metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin are among the most highly regarded works of African art. They are now scattered around European museums.
After the decision on Thursday, the next step will be to develop a road map for the return, which should be completed in the next few months.
That will mean inventorying all the items by June 15, followed by a meeting on June 29 to consider the best approach.
The 16th-18th century metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin are among the most highly regarded works of African art
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called the agreement ""a turning point in our approach to colonial history.""
""We have been working intensively for months to create the framework conditions for this,"" he said, adding: ""We have put the issue of museum cooperation with Africa on the political agenda and sought dialogue with our Nigerian partners, the architect and the initiators of the Benin Museum.""
""From archaeological cooperation to the training of museum managers and assistance with cultural infrastructure, we have put together a package and are continuing to work on it with our Nigerian partners.""
Nanette Snoep, a Dutch anthropologist and curator from the Rautenstrach-Joest-Museum in Cologne, said, ""museums and politicians have become aware of the fact that it is really necessary to decolonize museums. And decolonizing also means restitution.""
With this decision, Culture Minister Monika Gruetters said, ""We want to contribute to understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen during colonization.""
Hermann Parzinger of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation said the goal is to return the first items by 2022. He said talks are planned with the group's Nigerian counterparts to ensure ""substantial returns and future cooperation.""
Those would include talks about allowing some of the items to remain on display in German museums. However, Snoep says this decision must be made by the Nigerians.
""Nigerian partners can decide by themselves how this restitution will take place, how this repatriation will take place and, if some of the looted art will remain in German museums, it must be their decision how we will represent the Benin artworks in our museums and also what kind of story we will tell in our German museums,"" said Snoep.
The famous bronzes are to be found in a number of German museums. The Berlin Ethnological Museum holds around 530 artefacts from the kingdom of Benin, including around 440 bronzes.
Some 180 of the bronzes are due to be exhibited this year in Berlin's Humboldt Forum, a new museum complex that opened in December.
The restitution debate began many years ago, but were largely ignored by Western museums. It was also a taboo topic among anthropologists. According to anthropologist Snoep, a lot of Africans began making the call decades ago. ""African intellectuals first started this debate. Now we only hear the voices of Western museum directors and politicians. But the good fight started in Africa,"" Snoep said.
The curator adds that she hoped ""it doesn't become a white on white dialogue again.""
Most European former colonial powers have begun a process in recent years of considering the return of looted artefacts to the former colonies, especially in Africa.
The famous bronzes are to be found in a number of German museums
Last month, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland agreed to return a Benin Bronze sculpture to Nigeria, saying it was acquired by British soldiers in 1897 in ""reprehensible circumstances.""
That decision raised pressure on other establishments, including the British Museum, to follow suit. The British Museum meanwhile is reportedly considering lending its Bronzes to Nigeria.

In Nigeria's capital Abuja meanwhile, many people welcomed the announcement, describing it as a historic moment for Nigeria. ""I think it is a good development because those artefacts are our history in physical form,"" said Okwuchi Jim-Nna. ""It shows that Africa in general and Nigeria in particular has values and they are beginning to respect the culture of the people,"" Steve Farunbi added.
Jemilah Idomas said it was a ""laudable effort"" by Germany. ""Kudos to the German Government.""
However, a few Nigerians meanwhile believed their country was not ready to host the artifacts. ""Bringing such artefacts into the country which have immeasurable value will not serve the purpose,"" Samson Orija argued. ""We are not ready, yet. I think they should still hold onto it.""
""With the insecurity now, the safety of those artifacts cannot be guaranteed,"" said Shegun Daramola. ""So, until we are ready they should still hold onto it. When they bring it now may be another country will steal it. Or it gets missing within the country or get destroyed.""
Nigeria plans to build a museum in Benin city to house the looted artefacts after they are returned, a €3.4 million scheme in which the British museum will participate.
Late last year, France approved the restitution of 26 items from the Kingdom of Dahomey, located within present-day Benin, which had been pillaged in 1892.
""Restitution is really righting [the wrongs] of your own history. And so that's why African voices are crucial in this debate, that we do not, as white directors, recolonize a debate about restitution,"" said anthropologist Nanette Snoep.
Correction, April 30, 2021: The article previously stated that the items in France had been stolen from the Kingdom of Benin. That has been changed to Kingdom of Dahomey. We apologize for the error.
Ben Shemang in Abuja and Abu-Bakarr Jalloh contributed to this report.

3,Effort to Return Benin Bronzes to Africa Remains Ongoing ...,https://www.voanews.com/europe/effort-return-benin-bronzes-africa-remains-ongoing-challenge,"LONDON - The promise to return several Benin Bronzes from three Western institutions to the former Kingdom of Benin in Nigeria was celebrated by many. But returning all the artifacts looted by British soldiers 125 years ago will continue to be a challenge.
In recent weeks, a university in Scotland and museums in Germany and Britain pledged to repatriate the Benin Bronzes they own.
The restitution is hugely symbolic to Timothy Awoyemi, a British-born Nigerian who helped repatriate two Benin Bronzes in 2014 from a private collector whose grandfather had been part of the 19th century looting. Awoyemi says he was elated when he heard about the latest returns.
“They stole it so it makes me happy, because the stolen artifacts are going to be returned back to where they rightly belong,” he said.
British soldiers looted the Kingdom of Benin in what is currently Edo state in Nigeria, during a punitive military expedition in 1897. The high valued plaques, masks and sculptures functioned as an historical archive to the Benin royal palace. The sculptures made of brass, bronze and ivory are now owned and displayed across Western museums and institutions.
Oxford Professor Dan Hicks is the curator of the Pitts River Museum, which holds 145 Benin objects. He authored a book about the bronzes, and says the displays of stolen art in Western museums continues to hurt people in the present.
“The dispossession of arts and culture was a central sort of part of how military operations that sought to remove sovereignty, and sought to destroy traditional religion, and sought to remove identity, culture. That was a central part of what the Europeans were doing in the 1880s, 1890s across Africa,” he said.
Hicks says the argument that Western museums would be emptied out or shut down is unlikely as restitution needs a case by case approach.
Thousands of bronzes from the former Benin empire are held in private collections and in over 160 museums around the world. Most have offered to discuss loaning the bronzes instead of repatriation.
The British Museum in London holds about 900 Benin objects, the largest collection in the world. Its website reads no formal written request has been received for the return of the entire Benin collection, despite the bronzes being filed under “contested objects.” Additionally, laws would need to be changed because British national collections are prohibited from giving away their collection.
The African Foundation for Development, Afford, is a British based charity, which, for the past year, has investigated the challenges and obstacles related to returning African artifacts.
Executive director Onyekachi Wambu says that even if the national collections aren’t willing or able to repatriate, there are many more places and people owning Benin Bronzes.
“There's lots of different museums around the country, which have their own collections, and they're not covered by the law. There are others that are in private collections, and those are going to be much more difficult to do because, you know, those people sometimes don't want to do it,” he said.
It’s said over 90 percent of African cultural legacy is held outside the continent.

4,Germany first to hand back Benin bronzes looted by British ...,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/30/germany-first-to-hand-back-benin-bronzes-looted-by-british,"Germany is to become the first country to hand back the Benin bronzes looted by British soldiers in the late 19th century, after the culture minister, Monika Grütters, announced it would start returning a “substantial” part of the artefacts held in its museums to Nigeria from next year.
“We face up to our historic and moral responsibility to shine a light and work on Germany’s historic past,” Grütters said after museum experts and political leaders struck an agreement at a summit on Thursday.
“The treatment of the Benin bronzes is a touchstone [of this process]”.
Germany will present a binding roadmap for the legal and logistical aspects of the restitution process by the end of June, with the first objects to be handed over in 2022, said the minister, a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The bronzes, which were looted by British soldiers and sailors on a punitive expedition to Benin City in 1897, were subsequently sold to museums in Europe and North America.
The single largest collection of Benin bronzes is held by the British Museum, but about 1,100 artefacts have ended up in German museums in Hamburg, Cologne, Stuttgart, Leipzig and Dresden. At least 440 are kept within the collection of Berlin’s Ethnological Museum, and were due to go display this autumn at the Humboldt Forum, a newly opened museum of non-European art in the city centre.
However, last month, Hartmut Dorgerloh, the director of the Humboldt Forum, let slip in an interview that the museum was considering displaying only replicas or leaving symbolic empty spaces, with the originals returning to Nigeria instead.
Officials in Berlin had declined to confirm concrete plans for restituting the works, saying negotiations with the Nigerian side were ongoing – until this week.
The decision was pushed along by some German federal states announcing they would go their own way if there was no joint agreement, as well as a jostle between the chancellory and the foreign ministry – headed by CDU and Social Democrat politicians whose parties could be left out of power after elections in September.
A decision on the restitution was also facilitated by the fact that the Benin bronzes can be returned to a politically neutral body, the newly founded Legacy Restoration Trust. Both the Nigerian government and the royal family of Benin have in the past laid claim to the artefacts.
The Benin bronzes could in the future be held at the Edo Museum of West African Art, a new museum in Benin City designed by the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye. Germany says it will help fund a pavilion to hold some restituted artefacts until the museum is completed in 2025.
“Germany’s bold decision to return looted classic arts from the kingdom of Benin to their rightful owners is definitely applauded and goes in the right direction,” said Victor Ehikhamenor, a Nigerian artist and trustee of the Legacy Restoration Trust. “This is a huge step towards righting what is wrong, especially coming from a country that was a superpower in colonisation. Germany has chartered a path for other western countries struggling to find the right way to handle restitution cases.”
Jürgen Zimmerer, a historian of colonialism at Hamburg University, was more critical, saying the government’s announcement amounted to a face-saving exercise rather than an emphatic gesture appropriate to the historic context.
“Instead of unconditionally committing itself to returning all looted art, there is only vague talk of a substantial part”, said Zimmerer. “How this part is determined, and by whom, is left unsaid.”",2021-04-30,2021-04-30,germany become first country hand back benin bronze loot british soldier late 19th century culture minister monika grütters announce would start return substantial part

Benin Bronzes Are Scattered All Over the World. We Asked Museums That Hold Them Where They Stand on Restitution
On the heels of news that Germany's museums are making new strides towards restitution, we asked various museums to update us on their own plans.
Germany’s landmark announcement that it would begin to restitute Benin bronzes as soon as 2022 sent ripples through museum communities around the world. The contentious objects, known to have been looted from the Benin Royal Palace in 1897, are scattered across some of the most prominent museums the world over. From institutions like the Metropolitan Museum in New York, which holds 163 pieces, to the University of Pennsylvania’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, which holds 100 pieces, these treasures have become a focal point of debate in recent years over the restitution of ill-gotten goods from the colonial era.
All told, there are some 160 institutions holding Benin bronzes, a term for an array of pieces that span intricate bronze plaques, carved wood, and ivory objects. Nigeria has been actively pursuing their return, an initiative that has ramped up in recent years as plans have come together for a major museum to hold them, the Edo Museum of West African Art, in Benin City. It is due to open in 2025.
Artnet News reached out to 30 museums known to hold Benin bronzes to ask for an update on their position on restitution, and the status of objects in their collection.
British Museum, London
Number of Benin bronzes: 928
Position on restitution: “We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time—whether through trade, migration, conquest, or peaceful exchange…The British Museum works in partnership with colleagues, communities, and organisations across the world. We are currently collaborating with the Legacy Restoration Trust in Nigeria and Adjaye Associates on a major new archaeology project linked to the construction of the Edo Museum of West African Art. This innovative collaboration will investigate the archaeology of the Kingdom of Benin, including archaeological remains buried below the proposed site of the new museum. The Edo Museum will reunite Benin artworks from international collections. The Benin Dialogue Group, of which the British Museum is a member, will work with the museum to help develop this new permanent display of Benin works of art.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: No comment given
Initiatives of which the museum is a part: Member of the Benin Dialogue Group
Weltmuseum, Vienna
Number of Benin bronzes: 173, including 13 of which have been proven to have have left the Kingdom of Benin as a direct result of the 1897 invasion. Eight others were acquired significantly before 1897 and were part of the Habsburg collections since the 16th century.
Position on restitution: “The Weltmuseum Wien has been following developments in Germany and other European countries regarding the return of objects from the Benin Kingdom to Nigeria very closely. The collections of the Weltmuseum Wien remain the property of the Republic of Austria. The museum itself is not therefore authorized to make decisions regarding the return or deaccessioning of objects. Such decisions are made by federal government authorities in consultation with the museum… The museum has also committed to ensuring that Benin works from its collection are shown in Benin City; to be fully transparent to our Nigerian partners and the public about the objects in Vienna; and to continue to research the provenance and significance of the objects themselves.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: No formal request has been made for the return of these objects
Initiatives of which the museum is a part: Member of the Benin Dialogue Group and Digital Benin
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge, UK
Number of Benin bronzes: 136
Position on restitution: “In 2019, the museum developed a new framework for the return of artifacts. The policy notes that consideration will be given to whether artifacts were ‘appropriated in the aftermath of violence, for example in the context of a colonial intrusion or war.’ Over recent years, staff have visited Benin City, and Benin representatives have visited Cambridge.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: “No claim has yet been made for the return of Benin works, but it is anticipated that a proposal to return artifacts will in due course be made and considered through the process set out in the policy. Given the published criteria, it is anticipated that the claim would be supported and steps taken to return the artifacts.”
Oxford University’s Gardens, Libraries and Museums
Number of Benin bronzes: 105
Position on restitution: “The Pitt Rivers Museum has been working with Nigerian stakeholders, including representatives of the Royal Court and the Legacy Restoration Trust, to identify best ways forward regarding the care and return of these objects from the Court currently in the museums’ care… We acknowledge the profound loss the 1897 looting of Benin City caused and, alongside our partners of the Benin Dialogue Group, we aim to work with stakeholders in Nigeria to be part of a process of redress.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: No comment given

National Museums Scotland, Edinburgh
Number of Benin bronzes: 74
Position on restitution: “Our current policy on requests for the return of objects to their country or location of origin is that we consider each on a case by case basis.”
Initiatives: Benin Dialogue Group
Horniman Museum, London
Number of Benin bronzes: 50 objects, including 15 brass plaques
Position on restitution: “Any returns, including the future of its collection of objects from Benin City, is laid out in our Restitution and Repatriation Policy, published on our website. The policy sets out a clear procedure for repatriation claims and includes a commitment to sharing information and transparency of process. The Horniman has, at the time of writing, received no repatriation requests which means that no definitive decision has been reached about repatriation of any object.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: None
Initiatives of which the museum is a part: Partner in the Rethinking Relationships and Building Trust around African Collections project
National Museum of Ireland, Dublin
Number of Benin bronzes: 21 objects, including armlets, wooden paddles, figures, and a staff
Position on restitution: “Like so many museums that were opened in the 19th century, the museum has legacy collections that do not reflect contemporary collecting practice or ethics. The National Museum of Ireland is committed to engaging with colleagues and officials in Nigerian museums, to progress a restitution process in relation to the Benin Bronzes… All of this work will be further supported through a comprehensive strategy which is underway within the museum to fully investigate and adequately resource provenance research of the wider 15,000 object ethnographical collection.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: No comment given

Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver
Number of Benin bronzes: 20, including 14 of which have been identified as recent replicas and six which may be older
Position on restitution: “The Museum of Anthropology at UBC has been engaged in repatriation since the 1990s. We strive to fulfil repatriation as established by the UNDRIP, the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, and the UBC Strategic Indigenous Plan, reflected in UBC and MOA’s policies, namely the Guidelines for Repatriation.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: None
Initiatives of which the museum is a part: Digital Benin
Museum of Cultures, Basel
Number of Benin bronzes: 20 objects from Benin City, including 16 brass objects, two ivory pieces, and two wooden objects.
Position on restitution: It welcomes any request and open-ended dialogue
Status of restitution requests or returns: None
Initiatives of which the museum is a part: Benin Dialogue Group, Benin Digital, and the Swiss research group Benin Initiative Switzerland
National Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian, Washington, D.C.
Number of Benin Bronzes: 43 objects. Sixteen pieces are confirmed to have been raided in 1897 and 23 further artifacts that have an unclear provenance.
Position on restitution: “Members of the royal kingdom of Benin have visited the museum over the years, touring our exhibitions and collections storage and viewing the photographs relevant to the kingdom in our photographic archives. The museum has had a strong relationship with Oba and members of the royal court of Benin over the years. They are aware of the objects in our collection and appreciate that we continue to tell the story about how the kingdom’s treasures were looted from the palace in 1897. The National Museum of African Art is aware of the Legacy Restoration Trust in Nigeria, but we are not part of the Benin Dialogue Group associated with that trust and the formation of a new museum devoted to the royal arts of Benin.”
Status of restitution requests or returns: None
Initiatives of which the museum is a part: Digital Benin
Glasgow Museums, Glasgow
Number of Benin bronzes: Eight bronzes and 21 other cultural artifacts whose exact provenance has not been established, including objects typically placed on the ancestral altars of the Obas of Benin that are currently attributed to late 19th-century Edo culture
Position on restitution: “Glasgow will continue to build on its established approach to restitution, founded on constructive engagement, with the people of Glasgow and the descendent communities or nations making the request, to support each individual situation. Moving forward Glasgow Life, on behalf of Glasgow City Council, will consider the most appropriate way to directly instigate discussions with descendant communities or their nominated representatives, whenever we can identify them, by sharing all relevant information that we have. Through cultural agencies in Nigeria, Glasgow Life, has established a pathway of communication with the Royal Family of Benin, and as a result we are in a position to begin a dialogue.”
Restitution requests: 9 repatriation requests, six of which have been successful
Initiatives of which the museum is a part: Digital Benin, the PRM Devolving Restitution Project, and the Commonwealth Association of Museums
Cleveland Museum of Art
Number of Benin bronzes: Eight objects, including five thought to have been removed from the Benin Kingdom during the Siege of Benin of 1897 and three Benin works needing further research.
Position on restitution: “As all of these works are undergoing further research; the museum is not in a position to make a statement as to any future actions. The Cleveland Museum of Art’s profound commitment to transparency and the highest ethical standards is apparent both from the way that our curator of African arts has interpreted these works in our galleries and from our long track record of engagement around cultural property issues.”
Royal African Museum, Tervuren, Belgium
Number of Benin Bronzes: One
Position on restitution: “In the ongoing debate regarding the restitution of African cultural heritage, the museum takes an open and constructive position. It is an active participant in the dialogue with authorities and museum policy representatives, and with Belgians of African descent from the relevant countries. The RMCA acknowledges that it is not normal for such a large part of African cultural heritage to be found in the West, given that the countries of origin have moral ownership of such heritage… From a legal standpoint, the collections of the RMCA are the inalienable property of the federal state and belong to federal heritage. Restitution can only be decided upon by the federal minister for Science Policy within a strict legal framework and would require approval by parliament… There is currently no legal framework for restitution in Belgium.” Read full policy here.
Status of restitution requests or returns: No formal requests for restitution
Initiatives: Involved in a dialogue with the National Museum of Congo and of Rwanda to discuss a program of long-term collaboration and restitution.
Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada
Number of Benin Bronzes: One object with a confirmed provenance
Position on restitution: “The ROM adheres to the Museum’s Collections Policy which follows accepted museum standards and guidelines on the deaccessioning of objects.”

6,Path Toward Restitution of Benin Bronzes Advances in ...,https://hyperallergic.com/633045/path-toward-restitution-of-benin-bronzes-advances-in-germany-and-uk/,"In the UK and Germany this March, headway was made in the long campaign to restitute the Benin Bronzes, the thousands of artifacts that British troops looted from present-day Nigeria in a punitive mission in 1897. In Scotland, the University of Aberdeen announced that it would return a Benin Late Period bust, making it one of the first public institutions to commit to fully repatriating a Benin bronze. Meanwhile, a German delegation met with Nigerian officials to discuss a concerted restitution strategy, with an eye to the hundreds of Benin Bronzes in the collection of the Ethnological Museum in Berlin.
Nigeria has been petitioning for the return of the stolen Benin Bronzes — a group of artifacts including brass reliefs, bronze sculptures, and ivory carvings — since the country gained independence in 1960. Today, the largest known collection of these objects resides in the British Museum, which has more than 900 examples in its holdings. However, as Oxford University curator Dan Hicks notes in his book The Brutish Museums, the Benin Bronzes are dispersed across more than 160 museum collections worldwide, including many regional museum collections.
One such regional museum, the University of Aberdeen, acquired a bronze sculpture of an Oba, or Benin king, at auction in 1957. In an ongoing review of the collection, the museum determined that the sculpture had been “acquired in a way that we now consider to have been extremely immoral,” explained Neil Curtis, head of museums and special collections, in a statement. The university commenced a dialogue with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments of Nigeria, the Edo State Government, and the Royal Court of the Oba in Benin. With an expert panel’s unanimous recommendation that the bust be repatriated, the university has begun making arrangements for the sculpture’s return, which could occur within weeks.
In a statement, Nigeria’s culture minister Alhaji Lai Mohammed said: “The reaching out by the University of Aberdeen and eventual release of the priceless antiquity is a step in the right direction. Other holders of Nigerian antiquity ought to emulate this to bring fairness to the burning issue of repatriation.”
In Germany, there are at least 25 institutions with Benin Bronzes in their collections, with a particular concentration — over 500 objects, including 440 bronzes — at the Ethnological Museum in Berlin. Berlin’s Humboldt Forum, a new consortium of museums that had its virtual opening in December, has been criticized for plans to exhibit these cultural artifacts in spite of their questionable provenance. (The museum recently floated the idea of displaying replicas or text in the objects’ stead.) The fate of these objects, which are owned by the state, is presently in the hands of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.
On a diplomatic trip to Benin City in March, Andreas Görgen, Germany’s director of cultural affairs, met with Godwin Obaseki, the governor of Edo, to discuss the matter of restitution. They reached a multi-pronged agreement, which could be finalized this summer. The Art Newspaper reported that Germany agreed to “take part in archaeological excavations in the region, provide training for Nigerian museum employees, participate in the construction of a planned new museum in Benin, and return looted sculptures and reliefs in German museum collections.”
The planned museum, where the repatriated bronzes will likely land, is the Edo Museum of West African Art, a cultural hub designed by Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye that is slated to open in Benin City — right where the 1897 attack occurred — in 2025.
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation convened after the foreign ministry’s diplomatic trip to Benin City. It released a statement saying: “In the case of the Benin bronzes, a solution will be found that also considers the return of objects as an option.” The foundation emphasized that “it is an important first step that all Benin bronzes in Berlin are digitized and accessible online.” German culture minister Monika Grütters, who chairs the foundation, plans to meet with culture ministers, museum directors, and foreign ministry representatives this April to work out a national strategy for the restitution of the artifacts.
Bénédicte Savoy, the art historian who co-authored the 2018 Sarr-Savoy Report, which made a case for the restitution of looted colonial-era artifacts in France, sounded skeptical in conversation with German newspaper SZ. “It’s nice if it happens now,” she said of the German government’s recent efforts. “But the demand for returns has been in the room since 1972. You could have done that back then.”",2021-04-04,2021-04-04,germany march headway make long campaign restitute benin bronze thousand artifact british troop loot present day nigeria punitive mission

7,Global survey: where in the world are the Benin bronzes ...,http://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/will-museums-give-the-benin-bronzes-back,"Germany set the stage for a global movement to restitute colonial loot with its March announcement that it plans to hand over the Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The return of the treasures—which were looted in a British military attack on the royal palace of Benin in 1897—from as many as 25 German museums is part of a bilateral deal that will also involve Germany in archaeological excavations and the construction of a new museum in Benin City.
The agreement, which is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, marks “an important turning point”, says Yusuf Tuggar, the Nigerian ambassador in Berlin. “It is not just an agitation on the African side; it’s an agitation also on the European, the North American side. You have European curators, museum directors, government officials, diplomats and intellectuals saying, ‘Look, you have to return these things.’ Germany is likely to be a trailblazer in this.”
As many as 160 museums and institutions around the world hold artefacts looted from the kingdom of Benin in their collections. The Art Newspaper asked museums in five countries for their position on the restitution debate and whether they too are preparing to return Benin objects to Nigeria and its future Edo Museum of West African Art.
UK
Days after Germany’s announcement, the University of Aberdeen became one of the first institutions in Europe to commit to restituting a Benin bronze, saying that the head of an oba (king) in its possession was “acquired in a way that we now consider to have been extremely immoral”. Jesus College at the University of Cambridge has also pledged to return a bronze cockerel.
Around 45 British institutions hold looted artefacts from Benin. The Horniman Museum in London has introduced a process for addressing restitution claims but says it has “received no repatriation requests, which means that no definitive decision has been reached about repatriation of any object”. The museum has 26 items from Benin in a display that gives details of their forced removal and contested status.
The Church of England is also in discussions with Nigerian authorities about two Benin busts in its collection that were not looted but gifted to the then Archbishop of Canterbury in 1982.
The British Museum has one of the largest collections of Benin bronzes in the world, with more than 900 pieces, but it is prohibited from removing items from its collection under the British Museum Act of 1963. In a statement, it says only that “the devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged by the museum and the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects explained in gallery panels and on the museum’s website”.
The museum is nevertheless part of the Benin Dialogue Group, which brings together Nigerian representatives with curators of the main European museums holding Benin material. This has led to a joint archaeological project with the Legacy Restoration Trust, the newly formed Nigerian body overseeing the planned Benin City museum.
The trust’s director, Phillip Ihenacho, says: “If we were not confident that there would be the return of objects from the British Museum, it would be difficult for us to partner with them.”
US
Benin artefacts are scattered between 38 US institutions, which have been largely absent from the restitution debate until now. But momentum is building. The Fowler Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles “is committed to developing a process for considering the repatriation and restitution of African objects in its collection”, says the director, Marla Berns. “Our expectation is to begin discussions with authorities in Nigeria about the disposition of the 18 Benin objects in our collection in the coming months.”
Christine Mullen Kreamer, the chief curator of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art, suggested at a Columbia University conference on 9 April that the museum could lead restitution discussions among US institutions with Benin items. Another conference planned for June could be the occasion to establish a working group, she said. The National Museum of African Art holds 42 objects from the kingdom of Benin; provenance research is ongoing.
Other US museums we approached say that they are conducting provenance research, or are not yet ready to commit to restitution.
The Cleveland Museum of Art has eight works from the kingdom of Benin on view in the African arts gallery, five of which are thought to have been looted in 1897. The provenance of the remaining three is not yet clear. “As all of these works are undergoing further research, the museum is not in a position to make a statement as to any future actions,” a spokesperson says.
Similar statements came from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which has 32 Benin objects on show in a dedicated gallery, and the Baltimore Museum of Art. A spokesperson says the Baltimore museum is “following the discussions and debates about repatriation of artworks from the Benin kingdom very closely”, and is currently updating its own policies.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York holds around 160 objects traceable to the 1897 looting. A spokesperson says these “were largely given to the institution… in the 1970s and 1990s by individuals who acquired them on the art market”, but declined to specify the Met’s view on restitution.
Netherlands
The National Museum of World Cultures holds 114 pieces that can be definitively traced to the British military raid on Benin City. A provenance report published recently on its website indicates that a further nine Benin items purchased on the art market may also have been looted; research into these is continuing.
The institution, which comprises museums in Amsterdam, Leiden and Nijmegen, and oversees the city of Rotterdam’s collection at the Wereldmuseum, published a “commitment to transparently address and evaluate claims for the return of cultural objects according to standards of respect, cooperation and timeliness” in 2019. It has been a member of the Benin Dialogue Group since 2010.
The museum requires government approval before restituting any items in the Dutch national collection. In January, the Netherlands became the first country in Europe to approve a central mechanism for repatriating stolen cultural heritage and pledged to return, unconditionally, any objects in national collections that were looted from Dutch colonies. Claims for objects looted from other countries’ colonies—such as the Benin bronzes—will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by an independent panel.
The Dutch policy has yet to be debated in parliament. At press time, negotiations to form a new government after March elections were still ongoing.
Switzerland
Eight museums have formed the Swiss Benin Initiative to investigate the provenance of their Benin collections in a research project funded with CHF100,000 ($109,000) by the Federal Office of Culture. The project begins in June, coordinated by the Museum Rietberg in Zurich, and will involve collaboration with Nigerian partners.
The seven other members are the Bern Historical Museum, the ethnographic museums of St Gallen, Geneva, Neuchâtel and Zurich University, the Museum Schloss Burgdorf and the Basel Museum of Cultures. Together they possess 97 objects from the Kingdom of Benin; around 40% were acquired during the colonial era. Some are known to have been looted in 1897 but the provenance of others is unclear.
“Each museum has quite small collections of between three and 20 pieces, so we thought we would join forces instead of all conducting individual research,” says Esther Tisa Francini, the head of provenance research at the Museum Rietberg. She is co-leading the project with Michaela Oberhofer, the curator of African collections.
A detailed report, which will address the question of restitution, is expected to be published when the project concludes in summer 2022.
New Zealand
Benin bronzes travelled as far as Christchurch, where the Canterbury Museum has the largest collection in New Zealand or Australia. The museum possesses 17 items of Benin art, including ivory and bronze figurines, bracelets, amulets and three bronze heads.
Most can be traced back to the attack on Benin. Twelve were purchased at auction in London in 1898, and a further two in 1901. “The museum has not received any requests to return the objects,” a spokesperson says. “If we did, we would consider the request carefully as we do any request to return taonga (treasures) to their country of origin.”

Germany to return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria
Precious artifacts that were looted during the colonial era will finally be returned to Nigeria, the German government has announced. The first returns are planned for 2022.
In a joint declaration published Thursday, Germany's Ministry of Culture, state ministers and museum directors committed to ""substantive returns"" of Benin bronzes -- artworks made of bronze, brass and ivory that were taken by the British army in a raid on the Kingdom of Benin, in present-day Nigeria, in 1897.
The bronzes were subsequently distributed across the world and hundreds are currently held in German museums. Nigeria has sought their return for decades.
Osaisonor Godfrey Ekhator-Obogie, a historian and researcher at Nigeria's Institute for Benin Studies, welcomed the declaration, saying that Germany is ""leading in the global restitution movement.""
""Other European nations should be willing and open to acknowledge that all objects looted in 1897 belong to the Benin people,"" he said over email. ""Like Germany, they too should initiate or join the dialogue to discuss the future of these objects.
""This decision was a truce with parties, not a win-win or winner takes it all. I will tell my children about this historic moment.""
'Historic milestone'
German Culture Minister Monika Grütters described the declaration as a ""historic milestone.""
""We face a historic and moral responsibility to shine a light on Germany's colonial past,"" said Grütters in a statement. ""We would like to contribute to an understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of the people who were robbed of their cultural treasures during the colonial era.""
The declaration lays out plans for the first pieces to be returned next year, and for a roadmap to guide additional restitution, without specifying which artifacts or how many.
It also requires museums in possession of Benin objects to establish and document their provenance. Those details are to be to be published on a new website that will serve as an information resource and point of contact for restitution claims relating to any German ""collections from colonial contexts.""
Parties to the agreement have pledged to work with Nigerian partners, including the Legacy Restoration Trust, which is leading the development of the new Edo Museum for West African Art in Benin City, Edo State.
The announcement follows a visit by a German government delegation to Nigeria in March, after which the foreign minister Heiko Maas signaled support for restitution.
Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, who hosted the delegation, subsequently announced the launch of a ""legacy restoration trust"" and expressed hope that international cooperation would go beyond the return of objects.
""We believe that our collaboration should transcend to not only returning the works but also understanding the significant and meaning of those works from our history,"" said Obaseki in a statement.
Germany has also committed to supplying expertise and funding for the new museum, designed by award-winning architect David Adjaye, and recently launched a ""knowledge-exchange"" platform for collaboration between German and African museums.
Thursday's declaration has, however, received a mixed reaction from scholars in the field of restitution. Professor Jürgen Zimmerer, a colonial historian at the University of Hamburg, described it as a ""disappointment"" for not going further.
""There is a general commitment to 'substantial restitution', however this is rather vague,"" he told CNN. ""No firm schedule for restitution has been presented.""
But Professor Dan Hicks, curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford and author of a book on the Benin Bronzes, believes the declaration is a step forward.
""This clear statement from such a powerful group of German museum leaders, setting out their willingness to make substantive returns of Benin bronzes, will be very welcome to many,"" said Hicks.
""The fast-moving developments in Germany will move the needle on this question ... and will shift it up the agenda also for the trustee bodies, directors, curators and museum-goers at more than 150 museums worldwide that hold Benin collections.""
Nigeria's campaign
The bronzes have come to be regarded as among the finest artworks produced in Africa and individual pieces have sold for millions of dollars at auction.
Nigeria's campaign for their return predates the country's independence in 1960. The issue has often been a source of tension in relations with former colonial powers, such as a diplomatic incident in 1977 sparked by the British Museum's refusal to return an ivory mask on loan.
But after decades of little success, there have been signs of movement in recent years. In 2019, the French government commissioned a report recommending that museum artifacts from sub-Saharan Africa be made available for restitution claims. The directors of major museums in the Netherlands have supported calls for a new process for restitution.
A handful of institutions have acted on their own initiative. The National Museum of Ireland recently committed to ""progress a restitution process"" for its bronzes, according to the Times, while the University of Aberdeen has announced it will return a bronze.
But UK laws forbid national museums from returning parts of their collections, which has proved a significant barrier. The British Museum, which holds the largest collection of bronzes from Benin, has been a frequent target for campaigners.

“We face a historic and moral responsibility to shine a light on Germany’s colonial past,” says German Culture Minister Monika Grütters in a statement, as quoted by CNN’s Kieron Monks. “We would like to contribute to understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of people who were robbed of their cultural treasures during the colonial era.”
Read more about the Benin Bronzes—and recent calls for their repatriation—below.
In 1897, British colonial forces razed Benin City, massacring an unknown number of people and bringing a violent end to the Kingdom of Benin, which had thrived for centuries as one of West Africa’s major powers. During the raid, British troops looted at least 3,000 precious items made by the Edo people, including ivory statues, carved elephant tusks, ceramics, masks, carved portraits of Obas (or kings) and their mothers, and more than 1,000 intricately decorated brass plaques that once adorned ancestral altars and court buildings in the city’s royal palace.
More than a century later, the so-called Benin Bronzes remain scattered throughout at least 161 museums around the world, according to research compiled by Dan Hicks, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford. For academics and art lovers alike, the works’ fate represents colonialism’s destructive impact on Nigerian cultural heritage, as Nina Kravinsky reported for Smithsonian magazine in 2019. References to the artifacts appear in blockbuster movies and feature prominently in art world debates about if—and how—looted art should be repatriated.
Nigerian leaders and the country’s Legacy Restoration Trust (LRT) have advocated for the bronzes’ return for decades. Now, in the wake of a year of mass global protests against racial injustice, conversations about restitution are once again heating up, writes Frankie Lister-Fell for Museums Journal.
In one major development, Berlin’s Humboldt Forum—a new museum set to open this year—announced in March that it plans to fully restitute all of its Benin Bronze holdings. After the artifacts are returned, the museum may exhibit replicas or simply leave empty spaces to signify their absence.
That same month, Scotland’s University of Aberdeen said it would unconditionally return a sculpture depicting the head of an Oba. Per a statement, this move will make the institution the first museum in the world to agree to the full repatriation of a piece of art looted from Benin in 1897.
Likewise, reports Eithne Shortall for the London Times, the National Museum of Ireland has announced its commitment to returning 21 looted Benin artworks in its collections. South London’s Horniman Museum has also published a policy document that establishes guidelines for the potential return of 49 looted Benin objects, including 15 brass plaques, notes Craig Simpson for the Telegraph.
As Museums Journal reports, other British museums engaged in global repatriation efforts, such as the Benin Dialogue Group and the Digital Benin project, include National Museums Scotland, the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, National Museums Liverpool, and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge.
Much of the returned art could eventually go on display at the Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), a planned institution set to be constructed on the site of the razed Benin City. Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who also designed the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, plans to incorporate surviving structures from Benin City into the modern build, he noted in a 2020 statement.
At a virtual conference hosted by Columbia University on April 9, academics and museum professionals argued “vigorously” against a long-held notion: the idea that the bronzes are “safer” at institutions in the United States and Europe than in Nigeria’s “small but growing museum ecosystem,” as Alex Greenberger writes for ARTNews.
“Of course, we do have our problems, in term of the state of our museums in the country, but that will not remain as it is forever,” said Abba Isa Tijani, a member of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, during the conference, per ARTNews. “We have our plans to build more museums. That’s why the EMOWAA museum is a bold step.”
What’s more, added Hicks of the University of Oxford, Benin’s cultural heritage objects “have been equally unsafe in the hands of [the] British, not least because of [the] attack in 1897, which destroyed so much royal and sacred landscape.”
The British Museum, which houses 900 looted Benin objects—the largest collection of any institution in the world—has historically resisted the Benin Royal Court’s public requests for the works’ return. On its website, however, the London museum notes that it is engaged in “longstanding dialogues” about the fate of the bronzes.
Benin’s current Oba, Ewuare II, met with museum director Hartwig Fischer in 2018. Discussions about a major new archaeology project co-organized by the British Museum and Nigerian cultural institutions are ongoing. (As Lanre Bakare notes for the Guardian, the British Museum and other national institutions in the United Kingdom are prevented from permanently repatriating items by the British Museum Act 1963 and the Heritage Act 1983. Private, regional and local museums face no such restrictions.)
Some U.S. institutions have also taken new steps toward repatriation. As Catherine Hickley reports for the Art Newspaper, the University of California’s Fowler Museum recently announced plans to hold talks with the LRT about the repatriation of 18 looted Benin objects in its collections, including two bronzes and a carved ivory tusk.
Per the Art Newspaper, Christine Mullen Kreamer, deputy director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art, stated during the April 9 conference that the museum could lead discussions on American restitution efforts. It currently holds 42 objects from the Kingdom of Benin.
Despite the spate of recent developments, the path toward repatriation remains protracted and complex.
A spokesperson for the Cleveland Museum of Art, which holds at least five works thought to be looted in 1897 from the Kingdom of Benin, told the Art Newspaper that the museum is conducting research on its holdings and is not in a position to comment on potential repatriation plans. The Baltimore Museum of Art, which houses three Benin Bronzes, issued a similar statement. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, which holds at least 160 objects traced to the 1897 looting, declined to comment.

South London’s Horniman Museum and the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin have become the latest institutions to take steps towards the repatriation of Benin bronze objects in their collections.
The cultural treasures – looted by the British army from Benin City in present-day Nigeria, 1897 – have dominated the cultural restitution debate since Berlin's Humboldt Forum announced last month that it would return its Benin bronze holdings.
The National Museum of Ireland declared this week that it plans to return 21 Benin bronze items to Nigeria. The objects, which include armlets, wooden paddles, figures and a staff, came into the museum’s collection between 1898 and 1907. The museum has yet to announce a formal restitution plan.
Meanwhile the Horniman published a policy document last month outlining a formal procedure for requesting the repatriation of items from its collections. The museum's chief executive, Nick Merriman, said: “Our Restitution and Repatriation Policy sets out a clear procedure for repatriation claims… The Horniman has, at the time of writing (7 April 2021), received no repatriation requests which means that no definitive decision has been reached, nor even yet considered, about repatriation of any object.”
The Horniman has 50 objects that are believed to have been looted in February 1897 during the military invasion of Benin City. Fifteen of these objects are brass plaques referred to as Benin bronzes.
With fresh pledges of restitution moving quickly, Museums Journal spoke to museums across the UK to find out their latest updates on the Benin bronze repatriation issue.
University of Aberdeen
After an internal review, the university announced in March 2021 that it will unconditionally return the one Benin bronze sculpture in its collection. The review uncovered that the object was pillaged by British forces in an “extremely immoral manner”. The University of Aberdeen is the first British institution to agree to full repatriation of a Benin bronze.
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA), Cambridge
The MAA estimates that its collections include more than 160 artefacts which have or are likely to have an 1897 Benin City provenance. In 2019, the MAA developed a framework for the return of artefacts.
Director of the MAA, Nicholas Thomas, said: “No claim has yet been made for the return of Benin works, but it is anticipated that a proposal to return artefacts will in due course be made and considered.
“Given the published criteria, it is anticipated that the claim would be supported and steps taken to return the artefacts.”
A planned visit by Benin representative Enotie Ogbebor to study MAA’s collections was deferred following lockdown but will be rescheduled.
The British Museum (BM), London
The BM has around 900 objects from Benin kingdom in its collection. A spokeswoman for the BM said the institution is working directly with colleagues in Nigeria on the issue.
She added: “We are currently collaborating with the Legacy Restoration Trust in Nigeria and Adjaye Associates on a major new archaeology project, linked to the construction of the Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA)... The EMOWAA will reunite Benin artworks from international collections.”
Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford
Last month, Oxford University’s Gardens, Libraries and Museums released a joint statement stating that it holds approximately 105 objects taken during the 1897 looting of Benin city; they are currently under the stewardship of the Pitt Rivers Museum.
Since 2017 the museum has been part of the Benin Dialogue Group, which is helping to develop a museum in Benin, Nigeria, and exhibit the looted works on a rotating loan basis.
“We acknowledge the profound loss the 1897 looting of Benin City caused and, alongside our partners of the Benin Dialogue Group, we aim to work with stakeholders in Nigeria to be part of a process of redress,” the statement said.
Great North Museum, Newcastle
The museum holds one item from Benin City – a brass staff/stave in the form of a bird. Executive manager Caroline McDonald said of the staff: “Unfortunately, its acquisition history has been lost and our own research has not been able to establish how the item left Africa or whether it was part of the 1897 punitive expedition.
“We have just secured resources to undertake further research on all of our African collections as we do not have an ethnographic specialist in the team. If we find that the Benin item was, or was most likely, acquired illegally, then we would not hesitate to return this item.”
The Royal Pavilion & Museums Trust (RPMT), Brighton
The RPMT has several objects – two carved wooden Oba heads, a circular box and a carved Edo elephant tusk – in its collection that it believes may have been acquired through the British Punitive Expedition to Benin of 1897.
CEO Hedley Swain said: “We are planning to undertake provenance research into items with potentially contested histories in our collections and intend to work collaboratively with Africa-based researchers and institutions on the future curation of these items.
“RPMT is open to consider any requests from source communities to repatriate objects.”
National Museums Liverpool
The institution is part of the Digital Benin project, which is committed to assembling all the dispersed royal artworks from Benin City in order to digitally reunite them .
Janet Dugdale, executive director of museums and participation, said: “We have not been approached about the repatriation of Benin objects in our collections, but as an organisation, National Museums Liverpool is committed to engaging in open and respectful dialogue about the unconditional return of culturally significant objects on a case by case basis.”
Bristol Museum & Art Gallery
Bristol currently holds one Benin bronze, which came to the city in 1935 with little supporting information. A Bristol City Council spokesperson said: “We have been working with interested parties in Nigeria and those negotiating with them across Europe, as part of the Benin Dialogue Group. Following discussions with the LRT in December, we are awaiting further information on next steps from the stakeholders in Nigeria. Once we have been able to establish the level of agreement for their plans for a new museum, we will be able to progress towards establishing an action plan for the future of the artefact currently in Bristol.’’
National Museums Scotland
The institution has around 80 objects from Benin in its collection and believes that approximately 70 of those are connected to the 1897 expedition. Director Chris Breward said: “We are participating in the Benin Dialogue Group, which is committed to sharing information and knowledge and working towards a major reunion of the Benin works of art in Benin City. We are also working with the Digital Benin project to understand and share more about the provenance of the Benin objects in our care.”

This Art Was Looted 123 Years Ago. Will It Ever Be Returned?
The Benin Bronzes, some of Africa’s greatest treasures, were looted in 1897. After a chance encounter, two men made it their mission to return them.
In 2004, Steve Dunstone and Timothy Awoyemi stood on a boat on the bank of the River Niger.
The two middle-aged men, both police officers in Britain, were taking part in a journey through Nigeria, organized through the Police Expedition Society, and had reached the small town of Agenebode, in the country’s south. Their group brought gifts with them from British schoolchildren, including books and supplies. The local schools had been alerted in advance, and a crowd came down to the river banks to meet them; there was even a dance performance.
It was a wonderful — if slightly overwhelming — welcome, Mr. Dunstone recalled.
In the back of the crowd, Mr. Awoyemi, who was born in Britain and grew up in Nigeria, noticed two men holding what looked like political placards. They didn’t come forward, he said. But just as the boat was about to push off, one of the men suddenly clambered down toward it.
“He had a mustache, scruffy stubble, about 38 to 40, thin build,” Mr. Dunstone recalled recently. “He was wearing a white vest,” he added.
The man reached out his arm across the water and handed Mr. Dunstone a note, then hurried off with barely a word.
That night, Mr. Dunstone pulled the note from his pocket. Written on it were just six words: “Please help return the Benin Bronzes.”
At the time, he didn’t know what it meant. But that note was the beginning of a 10-year mission that would take Mr. Dunstone and Mr. Awoyemi from Nigeria to Britain and back again, involve the grandson of one of the British soldiers responsible for the looting, and see the pair embroiled in a debate about how to right the wrongs of the colonial past that has drawn in politicians, diplomats, historians and even a royal family.
By the end, Mr. Dunstone and Mr. Awoyemi would have done more to return looted art to Nigeria — with two small artifacts — than some of the world’s leading museums, where the debate over the right of return continues.

They’re also not made from bronze. The various artifacts we call the Benin Bronzes include carved elephant tusks and ivory leopard statues, even wooden heads. The most famous items are 900 brass plaques, dating mainly from the 16th and 17th centuries, once nailed to pillars in Benin’s royal palace.
There are at least 3,000 items scattered worldwide, maybe thousands more. No one’s entirely sure.
You can find Benin Bronzes in many of the West’s great museums, including the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. They’re in smaller museums, too. The Lehman, Rockefeller, Ford and de Rothschild families have owned some. So did Pablo Picasso.
Their importance was appreciated in Europe from the moment they were first seen there in 1890s. Curators at the British Museum compared them at that time with the best of Italian and Greek sculpture.
Today, the artifacts still leave people dumbstruck. Neil MacGregor, the British Museum’s former director, has called them “great works of art” and “triumphs of metal casting.”
There’s one place, however, where few of the original artifacts are found: Benin City, where they were made.
That may change. Benin’s royal family and the Nigerian local and national governments plan to open a museum in Benin City in 2023 with at least 300 Benin Bronzes. Currently the site is a bit of land that’s little more than a traffic island.
Those pieces will come mainly from the collections of 10 major European museums, such as the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, the Weltmuseum in Vienna and the British Museum. They will initially be on loan for three years, with the possibility to renew. Or, when those loans run out, other Benin Bronzes could replace them. The museum could become a rotating display of the kingdom’s art.
This hugely complex initiative — organized through the Benin Dialogue Group, which first convened in 2010 — is being celebrated as a chance for people in Nigeria to see part of their cultural heritage. “I want people to be able to understand their past and see who we were,” said Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo State, home to Benin City, and a key figure in the project.
But is the Benin plan — a new museum filled with loans — a more practical solution than a full-scale return, long called for by many Nigerians and by some activists? That probably depends on what you think about how the Benin Bronzes were obtained in the first place.
Ill-Gotten Gains
On Jan. 2, 1897, James Phillips, a British official, set out from the coast of Nigeria to visit the oba, or ruler, of the Kingdom of Benin.
News reports said he took a handful of colleagues with him, and it’s assumed he went to persuade the oba to stop interrupting British trade. (He had written to colonial administrators, asking for permission to overthrow the oba, but was turned down.)
When Phillips was told the oba couldn’t see him because a religious festival was taking place, he went anyway.
He didn’t come back.
For the Benin Kingdom, the killing of Phillips and most of his party had huge repercussions. Within a month, Britain sent 1,200 soldiers to take revenge.
On Feb. 18, the British Army took Benin City in a violent raid. The news reports — including in The New York Times — were full of colonial jubilation. None of the reports mentioned that the British forces also used the opportunity to loot the city of its artifacts.
At least one British soldier was “wandering round with a chisel & hammer, knocking off brass figures & collecting all sorts of rubbish as loot,” Capt. Herbert Sutherland Walker, a British officer, wrote in his diary.
“All the stuff of any value found in the King’s palace, & surrounding houses, has been collected,” he added.
Within months, much of the bounty was in England. The artifacts were given to museums, or sold at auction, or kept by soldiers for their mantelpieces. Four items — including two ivory leopards — were given to Queen Victoria. Soon, many artifacts ended up elsewhere in Europe, and in the United States, too.
“We were once a mighty empire,” said Charles Omorodion, 62, an accountant who grew up in Benin City but now lives in Britain and has worked to get the pieces returned from British museums. “There were stories told about who we were, and these objects showed our strength, our identity,” he said.
He said that seeing the Benin Bronzes in the world’s museums filled him with pride, as they showed visitors how great the Benin Kingdom had been. But, he added, he also felt frustration, bitterness and anger about their being kept outside his country. “It’s not just they were stolen,” he said, “it’s that you can see them being displayed and sold at a price.”
Insult to Injury
Benin City has been calling for the return of its artifacts for decades. But a key moment came in the 1970s when the organizers of a major festival of black art and culture in Lagos, Nigeria, asked the British Museum for one prized item: a 16th-century ivory mask of a famous oba’s mother.
They wanted to borrow the work, to serve as the centerpiece of the 1977 event, but the British Museum said it was too fragile to travel. Nigeria’s news media told a different story, reporting that the British government had asked for $3 million insurance, a cost so high it was seen as a slap in the face.
That incident is still fresh in some Nigerians’ minds, more than 40 years later. At a recent meeting of the Benin Union of the United Kingdom, an expatriate group that meets at a church in south London, several members brought up versions of the festival incident when asked about the Benin Bronzes. Then they started criticizing British museums, which they said never seemed willing to return stolen items, despite repeated requests.
“I wouldn’t go there,” said Julie Omoregie, 61, when asked if she’d ever been to the British Museum, a half-hour away by subway, to see the mask. It was “an insult” that it was in the museum, she said. When she was a child, she recalled, her father would sing her a song about the raid, and she would cry every time. “It is time for them to give us back what they took from us,” she said.
David Omoregie, 64, another member of the group, said “The British are very good at telling you, ‘We are looking after it. If you’d been looking after it, it would have been stolen by now.’”
He agreed with that once, he said, but he didn’t anymore: “You can leave your car to rot outside your drive; at least it’s your car,” he added.
Some pieces stolen in the raid have gone back to Nigeria from institutions. In the 1950s, the British Museum sold several plaques to Nigeria for a planned museum in Lagos, for instance, and sold others on the open market. But those were not the free, full-scale returns people call for now.
Pressure for those types of returns has grown recently. In 2016, students at Jesus College, part of Cambridge University, campaigned to have a statue of a cockerel removed from the hall where it had been displayed for years. Last November, the college announced that the cockerel must be returned. (It has yet to say when or how.)
In the United States too, students have protested the presence of a Benin Bronze at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. The museum has said it is looking to return the item, but was struggling to find out whom to actually work with: the Nigerian government, the Benin royal family or others.
But nothing has publicly gone back to Nigeria in decades, except, that is, for two small items. And, that’s thanks, at least in part, to Mr. Awoyemi and Mr. Dunstone.
Heading Back
When Mr. Dunstone got back to England from Nigeria, he couldn’t shake that note from his mind: “Please help return the Benin Bronzes.”
He didn’t even know what they were, he recalled recently, but Mr. Awoyemi did — he’d learned all about them and the 1897 raid as a teenager in Nigeria — and he filled Mr. Dunstone in.
Mr. Dunstone simply couldn’t understand why Britain still had the Benin artifacts, he said. That feeling grew one day when he went to the British Museum to look at its collection. He was blown away by the 50-odd plaques on display, and more so when a security guard told him that there were 1,000 more items in the basement. (In fact, the museum owns around 900 items from Benin, and many are in storage in another building.)
“We really did steal them,” Mr. Dunstone, now 61, said. “We weren’t at war, we turned up and hacked them off the walls.”
In 2006, Mr. Dunstone created a web page about the Benin Bronzes, with Mr. Awoyemi’s input. He added a note at the bottom of the page asking anyone with information about the whereabouts of any items to get in touch. The two men, who became friends as colleagues in the police force protecting the British royal family, even wrote to the oba in Benin and the Nigerian government, asking for permission to act as envoys to Britain’s museums to try and get the artifacts back to Nigeria.
No one replied, Mr. Awoyemi, 52, said. “We were so passionate,” he added, “but we were becoming frustrated with the whole thing.”
Mr. Awoyemi and Mr. Dunstone were just about to give up when, one day, in 2013, an email arrived. It was from a doctor from Wales named Mark Walker. Mr. Walker said he owned two of the looted items: a small bird that used to be on top of a staff, and a bell that had been struck to summon ancestors.
He wanted to give them back.
Mr. Walker, 72, is now retired and spends much of his time sailing. His grandfather was Captain Walker, who described the looting in his diary and took the pieces during the 1897 raid. They were once used as doorstops, Mr. Walker said, but after he inherited them they sat on a bookshelf, gathering dust. They’d be better off in Nigeria with the culture that created them, he said.
“My view is the British Museum should use modern technology to make perfect casts of its whole collection and send it all back,” he said recently. “You wouldn’t know the difference.”
At first, Mr. Walker didn’t want to go to Nigeria, afraid, Mr. Awoyemi said, that he might be prosecuted for having had them at all. But Mr. Awoyemi and Mr. Dunstone convinced him that the publicity from such a bold move could lead others to return items.
The Nigerian Embassy in London agreed to sponsor the trip, but pulled out when Mr. Walker insisted the items had to be returned directly to Benin City and the current oba, rather than to Nigeria’s president, Mr. Awoyemi said.
So Mr. Dunstone and Mr. Awoyemi mounted an amateur public relations campaign, securing appearances for themselves on radio and TV, to help raise the funds and show the royal court in Benin City that they were serious.
It worked.
In June 2014, Mr. Walker, Mr. Dunstone and Mr. Awoyemi headed to Benin City to return the artifacts to the oba.
The ceremony at the oba’s palace was as overwhelming as the welcome on the river bank that had begun the whole journey, Mr. Dunstone said. It was filled with so many dignitaries and journalists, there was initially no room for him.
Mr. Walker said he handed over the objects quickly, without fuss. In return, the oba gave him, just as calmly, a tray of gifts, including a modern sculpture of a leopard head’s that weighed about 20 pounds.
“I was horrified,” Mr. Walker said. “I’d gone all that way to get rid of stuff, not get more.”
Where Next?
If there aren’t more individuals like Mr. Walker on the horizon, looking to give unwanted artifacts back, is the new museum full of items on loan the best Benin City can hope for?
Maybe.
Nigerian government officials have played down the need for items to be permanently returned. Mr. Obaseki, the state governor, said at a news conference at the British Museum last year: “These works are ambassadors. They represent who we are, and we feel we should take advantage of them to create a connection with the world.” His message: Nigeria wants them on display in the world’s museums, not just in Benin City.
Some museums do appear open to returning looted objects permanently, rather than lending them. Last March, the National Museum of World Cultures in the Netherlands launched a policy to consider claims for cultural objects acquired during colonial times.
Nigeria could claim the museum’s 170 or so artifacts from Benin City under the policy, if it proves that the items had been “involuntarily separated” from their rightful owners, or that the items are of such value to Nigeria that it “outweighs all benefits of retention by the national collection in the Netherlands.”
German museums have agreed to a similar policy.
Given how many Benin Bronzes are in Western museums, it seems likely some requests made under those policies would be accepted.
Until the museum in Benin City is built, however, nothing is likely to be returned permanently unless it is done by individuals. No one has a firm idea how many looted items are in private hands, but they used to regularly come up at auction. (The record price, set in 2016, is well over $4 million.)
Mr. Dunstone said he had hoped that dozens of people would have come forward with items to return by now. The ceremony in 2014 received a flurry of media attention, and he went back to England expecting new Mr. Walkers to appear.
It didn’t happen. He got one email from a man in South Africa who claimed to have fished a Benin Bronze out of a river. He was willing to mail it to Mr. Dunstone for $2,500.
Mr. Dunstone, ever the police officer, suspected a scam and didn’t write back.
“I’m less proactive now,” he said. “But my heart’s still open.”
Mr. Awoyemi said he was disappointed, too, that no one came forward, but was excited by the museum plan. He was even willing to help with security, he said, if the oba would let him.
Mr. Walker can’t put the Benin Bronzes behind him, either. A few months ago, he was looking online at Benin Bronzes held by the Horniman Museum in London and came across an intricately carved wooden paddle. It was almost identical to two he had in his home, which he thought his parents had bought on vacation.
Then he realized his grandfather must have looted them from Benin City, too.
In December, he lent the paddles to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford — a member of the Benin Dialogue Group — with one condition: They had to be returned to Benin City within three years.
He wasn’t going to be getting on a plane with Mr. Dunstone and Mr. Awoyemi this time. “It would be harder to get two six-foot paddles through customs,” he said. He also didn’t want his motives questioned. He wasn’t returning the items for glory, he said: They should just go back. It’s the right thing to do.",2020-01-23,2020-01-23,advertisement support art loot 123 year ago ever return benin bronze africa great treasure loot 1897 chance encounter two men make mission return

12,A View from Nigeria - Contemporary AndContemporary And,https://contemporaryand.com/magazines/a-view-from-nigeria/,"We asked 9 art professionals from the Nigerian art scene for their thoughts on the meaning of Germany returning the Benin bronzes in 2022.
Naomi Edobor – Curator
It means I wouldn’t have to travel to western Museums to see the works of my Ancestors, and this is a communal feeling. The Benin Bronzes are carved elephant tusks, and ivory leopard statues, as well as wooden heads looted from the Benin Kingdom in 1897. These items have spent a century and a half away from their rightful home. Years have been spent attempting to plug the gaping void in our art history that this unsavoury event has left.
The debate over the Benin bronzes, which were looted by the British and returned by the Germans in 2022, is not one we should be having right now. The items belong to a culture, a people, and they should be returned because they hold meaning in our society and are an important part of our vernacular art and history. These items will serve as reference points for our people working in the culture and arts sectors, and more importantly, we will be able to save the future generation from the ripple effects this has caused to our collective history.
Folakunle Oshun – artist and curator
The returning of stolen property is always welcome, but it is clear which party benefits the most from this act of benevolence. There was no press release or media brouhaha when these bronzes were stolen, hence their return should be made in silence and with commensurate reparations on account of:
Museum tickets sold for over a century.
Sponsorships and funding received for exhibitions, research, loaning, and other projects surrounding the keeping of these works.
Emotional trauma to an entire community, city, country, and continent.
Funding for the storage and conservation of the returned bronzes for another century.
Knowledge and technical ability lost on account of the punitive expedition which paved the way for the looting of the Benin bronzes.
The subject of this return cannot and should not be fragmented or localized—over 2000 bronze pieces were looted out of the Benin empire by British forces, hence, all the players in this conversation should put their heads together and see to the complete return of all the works. The first step would be to prohibit their display in Western Museums.
Unlike the over, 8000 human bones as well as Namibian skulls held by Germany and returned in trickles, the Benin bronzes will not be used to score cheap political points; No apology is needed.
If there are no plans to meet these conditions or at least begin to scratch them, then the return of the works is pointless. If Germany needs to confront its colonial past, that should be the problem of Germany, the Benin bronzes should not be used as a cheap shot towards atonement.
A Hundred and Twenty Four years is indeed a long time to make a decision to return what was stolen. The big question is—of what value are these works to the average person on the streets of Nigeria? There has to be a consideration for the original intention behind the creation of these pieces and their appropriated usage in Western Museums. Their return must cost just as much as their theft did.
Their return must cost just as much as their theft did; there can be no quick fix.
Agwu Enekwachi – art writer
These Bronzes are among the over a thousand artefacts looted by British forces in the infamous invasion of the Benin royal palace in 1897.
When mentioned in art history classrooms or in public art and culture fora in Nigeria, it leaves many with a kind of angst that has led to the stretched clamour for their return while highlighting the inappropriateness of their acquisition.
Sustained demands and positive engagements have caused a rethink among cultural administrators and political leaders in the west, which is now yielding fruits. As we await the restitution of these artefacts, there is a need to move beyond arguments that will impede fruitful outcomes.
In Benin city, the origin of the bronzes, a museum designed by David Adjaye, the world-renowned Ghana-born architect is underway. Championed in Nigeria by public and private sectors collaboration and international support, the museum will hopefully receive these works soon.
Apart from the public museums, wealthy individuals in Nigeria and other countries of Africa are investing heavily in private cultural infrastructure like museums, which will complement the public museums in preserving such returned art heritage.
Restitution for what it stands for is to make things right from the standpoint of a perceived wrong. It should entail everyone honestly working together to realize it without allowing the loss of any part of our world artistic heritage.
Germany’s promise of returning some of these long-anticipated artworks should hopefully have a steady paced concrete plan that will encourage other willing institutions and countries still prevaricating to appreciate the imperative of completing the process.
Ozolua Uhakheme, journalist and Art Critic
Returning the artifacts is a welcome development because the battle for the return of the objects has been a long and complicated one.
The questions are how do we authenticate the originality of what they are bringing back? How prepared are the museums to house the works in conducive environment? What of the manpower to preserve them? How safe will these objects when returned? How much value do we truly attach to them?
These are questions the National Commission of Museum and Monuments (NCMM) will provide answers to. However, there is another argument that what the west is returning are like banana peel after eating the banana. Will the west be ready to pay interest on the proceeds made out of the artifacts in the past hundreds of years?
Mayo Adediran, Museum Administrator
It is a welcomed development. Now the Nigerian government should be at the center of all of this (return of the bronzes). Government should empower the ministry of information and culture under which the museum belongs and foreign affairs to use all the international diplomatic avenues through UNESCO, through UN, through bilateral relationships to seek for the return of these artifacts not just from Germany but from other countries.
Keeping these things (bronzes) away from us is robbing several intellectuals the capacity to deconstruct these art works, while Europeans have used our old art work to create new art works in their country. If we continue to keep it there (in Europe), they are advancing from it in multilateral ways, while we are losing.
Prince Yemisi Shyllon, Art Collector
My fear is that the values of those works will plummet. The word is plummet, because what is making our people clamor for the return of the objects is because of the high value it attracts.
The high value that those works attract globally are going to drop, they are going to plummet not drop.
What I have always advocated is that we should enter into agreement with those who are holding our objects of ethnography and archeology and look inwards first. While looking inwards, that agreement should give us the legal title to those works, and therefore attract royalties on a regular basis until a UNESCO sponsored monitoring program is put in place to ensure that those works receive the kind of attention that they have always been receiving around the world. It is only after the UNESCO sponsored monitoring team confirms we are ready that the works should be returned.
Professor Peju Layiwola, Professor of art and artist.
I think it is a great thing that Germany has come to that point that they realize that they cannot continue to hold our art works. There is something fundamentally wrong in learning about your culture from the outside.
To address a lack of interest from Nigerians after the objects have been returned, we should think of more creative ways of showing these works. I think those involved in receiving the works should think of ways to engage the public on these works once they have been returned.
Oliver Enwonwu, art administrator, artist
It is a welcomed development, we hope that they would not just return the works, but they would also partner with the Nigerian authorities to ensure that the works are properly displayed and preserved and they continue to be part of our heritage. It is also a way to build cross cultural ties within the two countries, and it also builds better development opportunities within the two countries. My take is that it will be a call to other countries to follow suit and return the objects with them.
Victor Ehikhamenor, visual artist & writer
Germany is the first country to make this kind of move and it is a good thing they are making this effort as a country. For Germany doing this, and finding the political will power to actually do what most countries have not decided to do, it is a welcome development. I believe that this will also help other countries to rethink their stance of returning the looted items from 1897. This also gives those who have been sitting on the fence or those who do not have the political willpower to return the looted items a reference point. Yes it is great.
Obidike Okafor-art writer
I am excited about the return of the objects back to Nigeria. The only way to grow as a people in any part of the world is by understanding your culture and your history, but you cannot understand it when the ‘lessons’ are far away. I only hope that it does not end in returning the objects, but it will involve collaboration, where the German and Nigerian governments do everything in their power to ensure that the artifacts do not lose their value because they have changed base.

13,Benin bronzes: With Germany set to return looted art ...,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/05/10/benin-bronzes-germany-nigeria-looted-art/,"But on display in London, he recalled, they carried the aura of war trophies.
Colonial soldiers had plundered his ancestors’ land, seizing what became collectively known as the Benin bronzes. Thousands of plaques, masks and figures wrought from largely metal, ivory and wood landed in museums across Europe and the United States.
“They look so out of place, out of context,” said Ogbebor, 52. “To see them in isolation, far away from home, kept for onlookers to gawk at without any real understanding of what happened — it’s like being a witness to your family story told wrongly.”
Some of the bronzes are now set to come home: Last week, Germany became the first country to announce plans to send hundreds of pieces back to Nigeria, starting next year.
The German restitution pledge, the largest thus far, has injected momentum into the push for other governments to do the same as nations worldwide grapple with histories of racial injustice. Protest movements have placed a fresh spotlight on old atrocities, toppled statues and called for the recovery of items stolen — often violently — during colonial rule.
“To hold onto the works is to add salt to an open wound,” said Ogbebor, a member of the Legacy Restoration Trust, which represents Nigeria’s government and regional leaders.
Germany’s culture minister said the shift stemmed from “moral responsibility,” and a handful of museums elsewhere have launched their own efforts as curators reexamine the bloody origins of prized artifacts.
Benin bronzes can be found at 161 museums around the world, according to research by Dan Hicks, a curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford and the author of “The Brutish Museums.” Thirty-eight are in the United States. Only nine of the institutions are in Nigeria.
Many institutions remain hesitant to relinquish the work.
The British Museum — owner of the world’s biggest collection, at roughly 900 pieces — is legally prohibited from releasing the Benin bronzes because Parliament regulates its inventory.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which has said it acquired Benin works from donors, has revealed no plans to return them. (The Met did not respond to requests for comment.)
Pressure has swelled over the last year, however, as protesters flooded cities, reinvigorating dialogue around painful memories. Atop the African Union’s agenda this year: fighting the coronavirus — and recovering stolen heritage.
“In the present moment, we are seeing a reckoning with institutional racism, which starts with the observation that institutional racism has a history,” said Hicks, the Oxford curator.
The Horniman Museum in London, a registered charity that holds 15 of the bronzes, announced in March that it would explore “the possible return” of anything plundered. Days later, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland said it would send back the bust of a Benin ruler. And last month, the National Museum of Ireland pledged to release 21 works to Nigeria.
Returned art will be installed at the forthcoming Edo Museum of West African Art in Benin City, which Ghanaian British architect David Adjaye has signed on to design. (Though the doors aren’t slated to open until 2025, organizers say secure storage is likely to be ready by the end of next year.)
Little remained after Benin fell.
The kingdom, which dated back to the 11th century, had been one of West Africa’s great powers. Historians say its earthen walls rivaled the Great Wall of China.
Then came the British, who by the mid-1800s were exerting control over the surrounding areas. Benin enjoyed trade influence that irked colonial leaders, researchers say. The breaking point came when West African forces ambushed a British expedition that had not received permission to enter the kingdom, killing dozens.
Britain responded with 1,200 troops, warships and 3 million bullets, according to Hicks’s research. Benin burned to the ground. Official documents offer no casualty number, but researchers estimate widespread death.
The British military called the destruction “punitive.”
Soldiers went on to loot the kingdom’s riches, telling British authorities that the ivory alone would cover the cost of the mission. Some kept the bronzes for themselves, making them family heirlooms. European art scholars lavished praise on the works, and they were quickly auctioned off.
The spoils of Benin sat on display in England just six months later.
Nigeria has been calling for their return since it gained independence in 1960. The theft stripped away centuries of knowledge, said Victor Ehikhamenor, an artist from Benin City. Generations lost the opportunity to build on the work of their forebears.
“I grew up with the leftovers,” he said.
And the narrative of white dominance lives on in revered places. Schoolchildren see the “punitive” language next to popular exhibits. Google “Benin bronzes,” and the search engine delivers a harmful euphemism: “Discovered by: British forces.”
“These works were not legally acquired,” said Ehikhamenor, a member of Nigeria’s restoration effort. “Museums are oversaturated with colonial conquests.”
Today, he said, the people and institutions that benefited from Benin’s collapse have a chance to make amends.
Museums can put the Benin bronzes in the mail or transfer ownership to Nigeria. Leaders in Benin City have embraced the idea of loaning them out to museums across the globe, just as Spain might let France borrow a Picasso painting — on fair terms, as equals.

14,Dismantling the Museum: Dan Hicks on the Benin Bronzes ...,https://www.gazette-drouot.com/en/article/dismantling-the-museum%253A-dan-hicks-on-the-benin-bronzes-and-cultural-restitution/23362,"In his recent book The Brutish Museums, Dan Hicks calls for the radical rethinking of Western museums. He uses the case of the Benin Bronzes to call for the return of stolen objects as part of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.

Dan Hicks is Professor of Contemporary Archaeology at the University of Oxford and curator of world archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum in the U.K. His book The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution focuses on the Benin Bronzes that were looted by the British during an 1897 punitive expedition to Benin City, in present-day Nigeria. As a result of the sacking of the city, thousands of objects from the Royal Palace and other ceremonial sites are now dispersed worldwide, with the location of many of these artifacts still unknown. Hicks uses the Benin Bronzes as a case study for a broader discussion of the role of museums in the ongoing history of colonial violence. Both historical and timely, the book highlights the inadequacies of the current, often empty, rhetoric of solidarity and anti-racism on the part of Western museums and, instead, calls for restitution and a radical reordering of museological practices in Europe and North America.
The occupation of the Kingdom of Benin by British troops in February 1897 resulted in a massive looting of cultural heritage. Thousands of brass and bronze sculptures, as well as objects in ivory, wood, ceramic, iron, and intricate coral-work were taken by soldiers and colonial administrators. These artifacts, dating as far back as the 14th century CE, were sold at auctions throughout Europe or passed down to the descendants of the men who took part in the expedition. The looted objects are now held in more than 160 museums and private collections worldwide, from the Metropolitan Museum in New York to the British Museum in London, from Toronto to Glasgow, from Berlin to Moscow, Chicago, Abu Dhabi, Lagos, Adelaide, Bristol and beyond. The Brutish Museums’ Appendices offer provisional lists of their worldwide locations. Hicks stresses the unfinished nature of these lists, expressing the hope that more museums and private collectors will review their holdings and come forward with information on additional, previously unaccounted for objects.
Benin Dialogue Group
The Brutish Museums is in part the result of Hicks’ involvement with the Benin Dialogue Group, a multi-lateral collaboration that brings together museum directors and delegates from Europe with representatives of the Edo State Government, the Royal Court of Benin, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) in Nigeria. Among the Group’s achievements so far is the founding of the Legacy Restoration Trust (LRT), which has been spearheading work on the Edo Museum of West African Art. Designed by architect Sir David Adjaye, EMOWAA will be located on the former site of the Royal Palace in Benin City and will serve as the home for restituted objects. As a condition of their membership in the Dialogue Group, European museums agree to support the return of the works of arts to Nigeria and EMOWAA. As part of this process, in March 2021, the German government has started with Edo State authorities regarding the logistics of returning looted objects held in German national collections. Also in March, The University of Aberdeen in Scotland announced that it will repatriate a Benin Bronze in its museum collection to Nigeria.
The Benin Dialogue Group is also dedicated to collecting and sharing the information about the looted objects, which has led to the creation of Digital Benin, scheduled to launch in 2022. The digital resource will gather in a single place object data and related documentation from collections worldwide. The project’s aim is to create a comprehensive catalogue of the artworks, their history, cultural significance and provenance.",2021-04-15,2021-04-15,recent book brutish museum dan hick call radical

In this paper I will present my research on the 'restitution' campaign that the Portuguese diamond company Diamang began in the 1950s and show how it was a propagandistic response to the British raze of Benin (1897). This will allow me to provide an interesting theoretical angle on current debates.
Pitt-Rivers' Antique Works of Art from Benin (1900) had a profound impact on Portuguese society. Detailing several bronze sculptures seized by the British during the raze of Benin (1897), this catalogue makes the Portuguese influence on some of their patterns and themes clear. While this 'revelation' was not enough to raise public sympathy for the plight of the Edo people, when Leo Frobenius proposed that Ife and Benin Art had an 'Atlantean' origin, Pitt-River's book allowed the Portuguese to counterargue that these masterworks were influenced by them instead. Throughout the 1930s and 40s, they were framed as part of the national heritage and became central to the imperial rewriting of Portuguese national mythology that was sponsored by the dictatorial New State. In the 1950s, Diamang, a diamond mining company operating in Angola, began financing the 'restitution' of hundreds of African objects back to the Continent, beginning with a 'Benin head'. Regardless of their cultures of origin, these objects were symbolically 'returned' to the Dundo Museum, a private institution located at the far North-eastern limits of Angola. Diamang's propagandistic efforts were framed as the creation of a 'Museum of African Art' in Africa, where racialized populations could be taught about their 'past' and admire 'masterpieces' taken to Europe by competing colonial powers. In this paper I will present my research findings on this historical episode, drawing conclusions that give us perspective on the terms of the current debate about 'restitution' and the creation of new ethnographic and Art museums in Africa.",2020-01-01,2020-01-01,click star addremove individual schedule need log avail functionality log paper present research restitution campaign portuguese diamond company diamang begin 1950s show propagandistic response british raze benin 1897 allow provide interest theoretical angle current debate pitt river antique work art benin 1900 profound impact portuguese society detail several bronze sculpture seize british raze benin 1897 catalogue make portuguese influence pattern theme clear revelation enough raise public sympathy plight edo people leo frobenius propose ife benin art atlantean origin pitt river book allow portuguese counterargue masterworks influence instead throughout 1930s 40 frame part national heritage become central imperial rewrite portuguese national mythology sponsor dictatorial new state 1950s diamang diamond mining company operating angola begin financing restitution hundred african object back continent begin benin head regardless culture origin object symbolically return dundo museum private institution locate far north eastern limit angola diamangs propagandistic effort frame creation museum african art africa racialized population could taught past admire masterpiece take europe compete colonial power paper present research finding historical episode draw conclusion give perspective term current debate restitution creation new ethnographic art museum africa,click star addremov individu schedul need log avail function log paper present research restitut campaign portugues diamond compani diamang began 1950 show propagandist respons british raze benin 1897 allow provid interest theoret angl current debat pitt river antiqu work art benin 1900 profound impact portugues societi detail sever bronz sculptur seiz british raze benin 1897 catalogu make portugues influenc pattern theme clear revel enough rais public sympathi plight edo peopl leo frobeniu propos ife benin art atlantean origin pitt river book allow portugues counterargu masterwork influenc instead throughout 1930 40 frame part nation heritag becam central imperi rewrit portugues nation mytholog sponsor dictatori new state 1950 diamang diamond mine compani oper angola began financ restitut hundr african object back contin begin benin head regardless cultur origin object symbol return dundo museum privat institut locat far north eastern limit angola diamang propagandist effort frame creation museum african art africa racial popul could taught past admir masterpiec taken europ compet coloni power paper present research find histor episod draw conclus give perspect term current debat restitut creation new ethnograph art museum africa
16,"From Germany to Ireland, a fresh push to return the Benin ...",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/from-germany-to-ireland-a-fresh-push-to-return-the-benin-bronzes,"As a decolonisation movement sweeps across Europe, there are efforts to return art looted by British soldiers in 1897.
The story of the Benin bronzes is one Timothy Awoyemi, a British-Nigerian police officer, knows well.
Like all schoolchildren in Nigeria, he was taught of the murderous 1897 raid when British soldiers plundered Benin City, stealing a priceless array of metal sculptures.
So, unlike his United Kingdom-educated colleague Steve Dunstone, Awoyemi was not entirely puzzled by the scribbled note thrust suddenly into their hands: “Please help return the Benin bronzes.”
It was 2004 and the pair were on a police outreach expedition, delivering books and supplies to communities along the Niger River.
Having received a hearty welcome in the small town of Agenebode, Awoyemi and Dunstone were about to depart, when a man pushed forward with the piece of paper.
Its terse message stuck with the police officers, and upon returning to the UK, they resolved to return as many artefacts as possible.
Despite years of hard work, little progress was made.
“We were writing hundreds of letters to museums and private owners, but we got no replies,” Awoyemi told Al Jazeera. A public appeal proved equally fruitless, and by 2013, he and Dunstone were ready to give up.
And then an email arrived.
Mark Walker, grandson of Captain Walker, a participant of the 1897 attack, had heard about their efforts.
He had inherited a small, intricately sculpted bird and a bell struck to summon ancestors, both looted from Benin City.
“They were with his family for two generations,” said Awoyemi, “but Mark wanted them taken back to their rightful owner.”
A year later, that happened.
With Awoyemi and Dunstone’s assistance, Walker travelled to Nigeria, formally returning the sculptures to the Oba (king) of Benin.
At least 3,000 other bronzes – and perhaps many more – remain scattered around the world, adorning the walls of Western museums, or gathering dust in private collections.
Despite years of campaigning, very few have made their way back to Benin City.
That could be about to change, with a fresh Western push to return what was stolen, fuelled in part by the decolonisation movement.
Last month, the University of Aberdeen became the first UK institution in decades to agree to the unconditional return of a plundered bronze, while officials in Germany are negotiating the full restitution of over 500 Benin objects.
The National Museum of Ireland is also working towards the return of stolen artefacts.
The Church of England, which did not participate in the looting but was gifted two bronze busts in 1982, has also signalled it would repatriate them.
Though taken with a pinch of salt, such announcements are welcome in Nigeria, according to artist and historian Peju Layiwola.
For years, she has used her artwork to raise awareness of the bronzes, believing them to be irrefutable evidence of Benin City’s precolonial sophistication.
“You can tell by looking at the metalwork that it was a very developed civilisation, as it still is,” said Layiwola, a descendent of the Benin royal family.
“The artists weren’t only skilled in their sculpting of the metal, but also in their understanding of aesthetics, in their ability to imbue cultural meanings; meanings that remain relevant today.”
Despite their deep cultural resonance, few modern-day Nigerians have seen a plundered bronze in person — the vast majority being stored overseas.
This, Layiwola says, deprives them of agency over their own history, hindering efforts to come to terms with an ugly colonial past.
“We were told that our culture was vulgar, that our religion was fetish, that we were pagans. So we must have some kind of reorientation, a new way of seeing African culture as a total culture — not one defined by others. Getting the bronzes back is key to that.”
The Nigerian government shares her enthusiasm.
In 2010, it helped create the Benin Dialogue Group: a team of African and Western stakeholders tasked with the artefacts’ return. Though progress has been slow, plans are now in motion for the world’s “most comprehensive display” to be established in Benin City.
From 2023, locals will be able to bask in the beauty of their ancestors’ bronze work, centrepieces of the new Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA).
The objects will be supplied by their current European custodians, initially on loan for three years, with the possibility to renew.
This caveat is a source of great anger for many Nigerians, said Awoyemi.
“They say they understand that the bronzes have present-day significance. Why then, should they only be provided on loan?”
It is a question directed largely at London’s British Museum, which holds more than 900 Benin objects — the world’s largest collection.
In a statement, the organisation said it “fully acknowledged” the devastation of the 1897 attack, and was working with the EMOWAA to “develop a new permanent display of Benin works of art.”
There is, however, little chance of full restitution any time soon.
The British Museum is legally prohibited from disposing of artefacts, a rule UK lawmakers would have to change before an unconditional return could be sanctioned.
That has happened in the past, experts note, and could again in the future.
“We’ve changed the law for other cases, be that in the very different historical circumstances of Holocaust spoliation, or with ancestral human remains for Indigenous people,” explained professor Dan Hicks, curator of world archaeology at Oxford University’s Pitt Rivers Museum and author of The Brutish Museums.
“How long can we say, just on principle, that we’re going to leave African heritage out?”
There is another dimension to consider: money.
For decades, Western institutions have benefitted financially from their Benin collections, drawing visitors by the thousands.
Meanwhile, said Awoyemi, the artists’ descendants are living in poverty.
“There are parts of the local community that are really suffering. People who are too poor to take care of their children, families that find it very difficult to eat.”
That is why, with retirement approaching, the policeman’s mind is on a new campaign — one focused not only on the restitution of artwork, but reparations as well.
“The local community needs both,” he said. “Only then will the wounds of 1897 begin to heal.”",2021-04-16,2021-04-16,decolonisation movement sweep across europe effort return art loot british soldier

17,"What Are the Benin Bronzes, and Why Do They Remain ...",https://www.artnews.com/feature/benin-bronzes-explained-repatriation-british-museum-humboldt-forum-1234588588/,"Over the past month, debates surrounding the Benin Bronzes—a group of thousands of objects plundered by British troops from the Kingdom of Benin during the 19th century—have taken a new turn. The Humboldt Forum in Berlin has said it will begin seeking the process of returning the hundreds of Benin Bronzes in its collection, and a Scottish university became the first institution to formally commit to returning a Benin Bronze to Nigeria. Why have the Benin Bronzes generated so much controversy, and what will happen to them in the years to come? Below, a guide to the artworks and their history.
What are the Benin Bronzes?
The Benin Bronzes are a group of thousands of objects that were taken from the kingdom of Benin, in what is now Nigeria, in 1897. (Their exact number is unknown, though it is believed to exceed 3,000.) These objects—including figurines, tusks, sculptures of Benin’s rulers, and an ivory mask—were looted by British troops, and have since been dispersed around the world, with the bulk of the works now residing with state museums in Europe. Contrary to the name, not all of the works are made of bronze. Because they made their way beyond West Africa as a result of a colonial conquest, the Benin Bronzes have faced calls for their return, both within Nigeria and outside it.
How were the Benin Bronzes plundered?
In 1897, James Phillips, an unarmed British explorer, visited the Kingdom of Benin. The kingdom’s ruler, the Oba Ovonramwen, welcomed Phillips, who decided to continue the expedition, even though he had been warned not to come to the Oba’s kingdom during a sacred period for its members. Chiefs reporting to Ovonramwen believed that Phillips and his expedition would interrupt a series of rituals, and a dispute occurred. Phillips, several in his mission, and 200 African porters were killed. To avenge their deaths, the British empire sent troops to steal artifacts from the kingdom, and they walked away with thousands of priceless objects. Some were placed on loan to the British Museum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in England, and many more were sold to British and German institutions, as well as private dealers. According to the British Museum’s website, certain people who took part in the Benin expedition also kept Benin Bronzes for themselves.
What have Nigerians said about the Benin Bronzes?
For many Nigerians, the Benin Bronzes are a potent reminder of colonialism and its continued effects on African society. Citizens in the country have long called for the return of the Benin Bronzes, though institutions outside its borders have been reticent to heed them. In 1977, FESTAC ’77, a Lagos arts event that took as its title the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, used a 16th-century ivory mask once worn by an Oba as its symbol. There are four known copies of the mask, with the most well-known one residing at the British Museum in London, where it is on permanent display. In the run-up to the festival, Nigerians began clamoring for the return of the British Museum mask, and when that became impossible, a committee began seeking a loan. That, too, never came to pass.
Nigerians have continued to demand that museums across the world give back their Benin Bronzes. The Lagos- and U.S.-based artist Victor Ehikhamenor, for example, wrote an impassioned New York Times op-ed on the subject in 2020. His essay concluded: “Generations of Africans have already lost incalculable history and cultural reference points because of the absence of some of the best artworks created on the continent. We shouldn’t have to ask, over and over, to get back what is ours.”
Which museums hold Benin Bronzes?
Institutions on several continents hold objects from the Benin Bronzes group, many of which are considered highly valuable. The British Museum has the most Benin Bronzes of any institution worldwide, with 900 objects from the group in its holdings. Because of the vast number of Benin Bronzes in its collection, the British Museum has repeatedly been the subject of protests from activists, scholars, and artists who claim that the institution owns stolen property. Berlin’s Ethnological Museum—now a part of the newly built Humboldt Forum, which also houses a research laboratory—has also faced pushback because it owns more than 500 objects from the Benin Bronzes cache, as well as other works that various figures have claimed should be repatriated to their former owners.
Yet these are but two of the many museums around the globe that hold Benin Bronzes. In his 2020 book The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution, scholar Dan Hicks compiled a list of the 161 institutions that have acquired Benin Bronzes by various means. His list includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Musée du Quai Branly–Jacques Chirac in Paris, the Vatican Museums, the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, and the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Whereas 45 U.K. institutions and 38 U.S. institutions hold Benin Bronzes, just 9 Nigerian ones own objects from the group, according to Hicks’s count.
How has the British Museum responded to protests?
On its website, the British Museum has written that “no formal request has been received for the return of the Museum’s Benin collections in their entirety,” and that the museum is engaged in “longstanding dialogues” with the current Oba, Ewuare II, who visited the museum in 2018 and met with director Hartwig Fischer.
Who has returned their Benin Bronzes?
Just one institution has committed to repatriating a Benin Bronze work, though others have made promises to start seeking discussions about sending back objects from the group. In March 2021, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland called its 1957 acquisition of a sculpture of the Oba at auction in London “extremely immoral” and vowed to send the work home. Nigeria’s minister of information and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, encouraged others to follow suit.
The University of Aberdeen’s groundbreaking decision followed major developments days earlier at the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, which said it would start pursuing the process of repatriating its Benin Bronzes. A decision on whether they can return to Nigeria will be left to the board of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which manages the collection of the Ethnological Museum. The Humboldt Forum’s director, Hartmut Dorgerloh, said the museum would not show its Benin Bronzes, leaving blank spaces or exhibiting copies in their place, though the institution plans to forge on with a display devoted to the group.
Meanwhile, in 2019, after a report by academics Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy recommended that France begin repatriating plundered African art in its holdings, the French state pledged to return 26 Benin Bronzes in the national collection. Progress has been slow, however, as politicians in the country have historically been resistant to repatriating African art, claiming that it constitutes French heritage, and as of April 2021, none of the Benin Bronzes have permanently left France.
Where will the Benin Bronzes go if they are sent back to Nigeria?
Nigerians have been eagerly awaiting the return of the Benin Bronzes, and with the expectation some will head back in the years to come, a museum is being built to house them in Benin City. That institution, the Edo Museum of West African Art, is being designed by architect David Adjaye and is currently set to open in 2025. It is expected to be host to the most comprehensive collection of Benin Bronzes to date.",2021-04-02,2021-04-02,past month debate surround benin bronzes—a group thousand object plunder british troop

18,Germany to return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria - The World,https://www.pri.org/stories/2021-05-17/germany-plans-return-looted-benin-bronzes-nigeria-will-other-countries-follow,"In a historic move last month, Germany agreed to return priceless artifacts to Nigeria that were stolen during the colonization of Africa in the 19th century.
Germany has the second-largest collection of Benin Bronzes in the world and will start repatriating the pieces starting in 2022. The bronzes will be housed in a new museum in Benin City, Nigeria.
“We are facing the historical and moral responsibility to bring Germany’s colonial past to light and to come to terms with it. Dealing with the Benin Bronzes is a touchstone.”
“We are facing the historical and moral responsibility to bring Germany’s colonial past to light and to come to terms with it,” Germany’s culture minister Monika Grütters said in a statement. “Dealing with the Benin Bronzes is a touchstone.”

The Benin Bronzes — regarded as one of Africa’s greatest artistic treasures — are a group of more than a thousand brass sculptures and plaques from at least the 16th century onward in the ancient, West African Kingdom of Benin, in present-day Nigeria. The bronzes once decorated the royal palace and recalled Benin’s great history, wealth and military might.
In 1897, British colonial forces attacked the Kingdom of Benin, burning down villages and towns and massacring residents. The colonial army also ransacked the royal palace, taking ivory, wooden carvings, masks, plaques and reliefs. The British shipped the loot back to London and sold it off. Today, the objects are on display in some of the most famous museums in Europe and the United States.

For many inside and outside of Africa, the Benin Bronzes are symbols of colonialism and exploitation, and they’ll stay that way until they’re returned.
“Since the early 1960s, the Nigerian government and authorities have been pressing for the restitution of [the] Benin Bronzes,” said Princeton University professor Chika Okeke-Agulu, who has been part of the restitution effort. “And all through the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, these claims have not abated.”
Museums have given a range of excuses over the years for why they couldn’t possibly give back the bronzes. In the ’70s and ’80s, museum officials argued African museums didn’t have the resources to care for the artifacts. And more recently, some institutions argued there was no legal framework for returning them.

Barbara Plakensteiner, a founding member of the Benin Dialogue Group — a consortium of European and Nigerian museums that’s been working toward restitution for a decade, said the negotiations have been complicated. In Germany, the decision to return artifacts isn’t actually up to the museums. It’s up to the government.

“Basically, all of the collections are publicly owned by various federal, states or municipalities. If items from public collections are deaccessioned or returned, it is a major political process,” Plakensteiner said.
But at a certain point, she said, there has been a consensus in Germany that the moral considerations outweigh the logistical ones.
“There is a political understanding in Germany that this needs to happen. And I think 10 years ago, that was not the case.”
“There is a political understanding in Germany that this needs to happen. And I think 10 years ago, that was not the case,” Plakensteiner said.
Over those 10 years, Okeke-Agulu said, there’s been a changing of the guard — old-school museum curators and politicians have retired, and a new generation has taken their place.
“These days, museum administrators are beginning to wonder, ‘Why do we have all of these things, especially if there's all this information about how violently they were expropriated from these places,’” Okeke-Agulu said.

After Germany’s big announcement, all eyes are on the British Museum, which holds the world’s largest collection of Benin Bronzes. While the British Museum hasn't committed to returning the bronzes publicly, Okeke-Agulu said they might be well on their way. The British Museum is part of the Benin Dialogue Group and has been raising funds for the new museum in Benin City.
“They are in. I don't see how they're going to back out,” Okeke-Agulu said.
World-class museums in the United States like The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, have Benin Bronzes in their collections.
Okeke-Agulu said American museums are trying to morally distance themselves, with various claims.
“We're not an African empire. It is the problem of the Europeans, they need to sort it out. These are arguments that American museums have made for the longest time,” Okeke-Agulu said.

19,The Benin Bronzes and the Cultural History of Museums ...,https://daily.jstor.org/the-benin-bronzes-and-the-cultural-history-of-museums/,"In 1897, when British soldiers annexed the Kingdom of Benin in what is now southern Nigeria, Benin City was sacked. Hundreds of metal and marble sculptures, some dating back to the thirteenth century, were carted off to Europe. Many others were destroyed during a massacre that left untold Africans dead.
Like the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes, as they came to be known, are the subject of impassioned debate over cultural heritage, restitution and repatriation, and the function of museums. A few of the original sculptures (and some copies) have been returned to Nigeria, which has campaigned for their return since independence in 1960. Hundreds remain in museums in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and the United States.
Scholar Annie E. Coombes writes that the original September 1897 exhibition at the British Museum of some three hundred Benin brass plaques set a template for the reception and debate about the looted works.
The exhibit caused a sensation. Viewers—in person and through the medium of the press—were amazed that people they had been led to believe were “savages” had produced such things.
“Intrigued and perplexed that work of such technical expertise and naturalism had been found in such quantities in Africa, the national, local, scientific, and middle-class illustrated press all postulated hypotheses to ‘explain’ the paradox,” Coombes writes.
Initially, the works were attributed to Portuguese or Egyptian origin. As Coombes describes it, the “admissibility of an African origin” was largely the result of politics within the British Museum itself. The museum’s experts in Egyptology were well established, but by the late 1890s, ethnologists and anthropologists there also wanted national recognition and the financial support it signified. That meant giving greater status to African works, like those from Benin.
The context was imperial rivalry between European powers, like Britain and Germany. Symbolically, competition in Africa would be measured by museum collections: A valuable trove of African artworks would signify power. British “anthropologists consistently played the German threat as a card in their bid for popular and government support,” Coombes writes.
Weekly Newsletter
For the new field of anthropology, which wanted the imprimatur of science, keeping the bronzes “as both evidence of barbaric savagery and artistic anomaly” became a matter of “national urgency,” according to Coombes.
Coombes notes that the “contradictions that made [the bronzes] such potent icons in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries” are still going today. Through the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, British governments “have argued for their continued custody of this property on the basis of the internationalism of museum culture.” At the same time, she notes, they have asserted “the significance of the ‘bronzes’ and marbles as a part of British national heritage.”

20,Germany to return Benin Bronzes looted during colonial era ...,https://www.africanews.com/2021/04/30/germany-to-return-benin-s-bronzes-looted-during-colonial-era//,"Heritage
Germany is returning hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes that were mostly looted from West Africa by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums, authorities said Friday.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas welcomed a deal reached with museums and authorities in Nigeria to work on a restitution plan for a substantial number of artifacts, calling it a “turning point in dealing with our colonial history.”
Germany’s minister for culture, Monika Gruetters, said the Benin Bronzes were a key test for the way the country deals with its colonial past.
“We are confronting our historic and moral responsibility,” she said.
Gruetters said the goal is to contribute to “understanding and reconciliation” with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen in colonial times. The first returns are planned for next year, she said.
A historian welcomed the plans, but said they don't go far enough.
“Sadly, there is neither a precise time plan nor an unconditional commitment to restitute all looted artifacts,” said Juergen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg.
He also noted it's not yet clear how many objects will be returned, or whether there will be any recognition of the efforts by civil society groups that had called for the restitution.
A British colonial expedition looted vast numbers of treasures from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, including numerous bas-reliefs and sculptures.
While hundreds of artifacts ended up in the British Museum, hundreds were also sold to other collections such as the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, which has one of the world's largest collection of historical objects from the Kingdom of Benin, estimated to include about 530 items, including 440 bronzes.
The British Museum doesn't currently have plans to return parts of its collection.
“The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged,” the British Museum said in a statement, adding that the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects is explained in gallery panels and on its website.
“We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest or peaceful exchange,” it said.
But Zimmerer, who has done extensive historical research on the Benin Bronzes, said the decision by Germany would likely affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle such artifacts.
“The pressure will grow, because the British position of simply not addressing the issue of restitution is no longer sustainable,” he said.",,2021-04-30,heritage germany return hundred artifact know benin bronze mostly loot west africa british colonial expedition subsequently sell collection around world include german museum authority say friday foreign minister heiko maas welcome deal reach museum authority nigeria work restitution plan substantial number artifact call turn point deal colonial history germany minister culture monika gruetters say benin bronze key test way country deal colonial past we confront historic moral responsibility say gruetters say goal contribute understand reconciliation descendant whose cultural treasure steal colonial time first return plan next year say historian welcome plan say far enough sadly neither precise time plan unconditional commitment restitute loot artifact say juergen zimmerer professor global history university hamburg also note yet clear many object return whether recognition effort civil society group call restitution british colonial expedition loot vast number treasure royal palace kingdom benin 1897 include numerous ba relief sculpture hundred artifact end british museum hundred also sell collection ethnological museum berlin one world large collection historical object kingdom benin estimate include 530 item include 440 bronze british museum currently plan return part collection the devastation plunder wreak upon benin city british military expedition 1897 fully acknowledge british museum say statement add circumstance around acquisition benin object explain gallery panel website we believe strength british museum collection resides breadth depth allow million visitor understand culture world interconnect time – whether trade migration conquest peaceful exchange say zimmerer do extensive historical research benin bronze say decision germany would likely affect wider debate institution former colonial country handle artifact the pressure grow british position simply address issue restitution longer sustainable say,heritag germani return hundr artifact known benin bronz mostli loot west africa british coloni expedit subsequ sold collect around world includ german museum author said friday foreign minist heiko maa welcom deal reach museum author nigeria work restitut plan substanti number artifact call turn point deal coloni histori germani minist cultur monika gruetter said benin bronz key test way countri deal coloni past we confront histor moral respons said gruetter said goal contribut understand reconcili descend whose cultur treasur stolen coloni time first return plan next year said historian welcom plan said far enough sadli neither precis time plan uncondit commit restitut loot artifact said juergen zimmer professor global histori univers hamburg also note yet clear mani object return whether recognit effort civil societi group call restitut british coloni expedit loot vast number treasur royal palac kingdom benin 1897 includ numer ba relief sculptur hundr artifact end british museum hundr also sold collect ethnolog museum berlin one world largest collect histor object kingdom benin estim includ 530 item includ 440 bronz british museum current plan return part collect the devast plunder wreak upon benin citi british militari expedit 1897 fulli acknowledg british museum said statement ad circumst around acquisit benin object explain galleri panel websit we believ strength british museum collect resid breadth depth allow million visitor understand cultur world interconnect time – whether trade migrat conquest peac exchang said zimmer done extens histor research benin bronz said decis germani would like affect wider debat institut former coloni countri handl artifact the pressur grow british posit simpli address issu restitut longer sustain said
21,Restitution of Benin Bronzes Likely as Public Awareness ...,https://www.artandobject.com/news/restitution-benin-bronzes-likely-public-awareness-mounts,"Though referred to as Benin Bronzes, these artworks are actually made of many different materials including wood, ivory, ceramic, and yes—bronze. A little under 200 of these sculptures are portrait busts of the deceased kings, or Obas, of Benin. Some of these date back to the twelfth century.
Plans have been set by German officials to send their share of Benin objects—about 530 artworks, 440 of which are bronzes—to Nigeria for eventual display at the Edo Museum of West African Art. While the museum, which will stand where the Palace of Benin once stood, will not be fully constructed until 2025, a center for study is set to be erected by the end of this year. Though it seems that transference of ownership is expected, nothing has been formally decided.

22,Benin Bronzes - Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_Bronzes,"Benin Bronzes
The Benin Bronzes are a group of more than a thousand[a] metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in what is now Nigeria. Collectively, the objects form the best known examples of Benin art, and were created from the 13th century onwards by artists of the Edo people.[3][4] Apart from the plaques, other sculptures in brass or bronze include some famous portrait heads, jewellery and smaller pieces.
Most of the plaques and other objects were looted by British forces during the Benin Expedition of 1897 as imperial control was being consolidated in Southern Nigeria.[5] Two hundred pieces were taken to the British Museum in London, while the rest found their way to other European museums.[6] A large number are held by the British Museum[5] with other notable collections in Germany and the United States.[7]
The Benin Bronzes led to a greater appreciation in Europe of African culture and art. Initially, it appeared incredible to the discoverers that people ""supposedly so primitive and savage"" were responsible for such highly developed objects.[8] Some even wrongly concluded that Benin knowledge of metallurgy came from the Portuguese traders who were in contact with Benin in the early modern period.[8] The Kingdom of Benin was a hub of African civilization long before Portuguese traders visited,[9] and it is clear that the bronzes were made in Benin by an indigenous culture. Many of the dramatic sculptures date to the 13th century, centuries before European contact, and a large part of the collection dates to the 15th and 16th centuries. It is believed that two ""golden ages"" in Benin metal workmanship occurred during the reigns of Esigie (fl. 1550) and of Eresoyen (1735–1750), when their workmanship achieved its highest quality.[10]
While the collection is known as the Benin Bronzes, like most West African ""bronzes"" the pieces are mostly made of brass of variable composition.[b] There are also pieces made of mixtures of bronze and brass, of wood, of ceramic, and of ivory, among other materials.[12] The metal pieces were made using lost-wax casting and are considered among the best sculptures made using this technique.[13]
History[edit]
Social context and creation[edit]
Olfert Dapper, a Dutch writer, describing Benin in his book Description of Africa (1668)[14]
The Kingdom of Benin, which occupied parts of present-day Nigeria between the fourteenth and nineteenth centuries, was very rich in sculptures of diverse materials, such as iron, bronze, wood, ivory, and terra cotta. The Oba's palace in Benin, the site of production for the royal ancestral altars, also was the backdrop for an elaborate court ceremonial life in which the Oba of Benin, his warriors, chiefs and titleholders, priests, members of the palace societies and their constituent guilds, foreign merchants and mercenaries, and numerous retainers and attendants all took part. The palace, a vast sprawling agglomeration of buildings and courtyards, was the setting for hundreds of rectangular brass plaques whose relief images portray the persons and events that animated the court.[15]
Bronze and ivory objects had a variety of functions in the ritual and courtly life of the Kingdom of Benin. They were used principally to decorate the royal palace, which contained many bronze works.[16] They were hung on the pillars of the palace by nails punched through them.[15] As a courtly art, their principal objective was to glorify the Oba—the divine king—and the history of his imperial power or to honour the Iyoba of Benin (the queen mother).[17] Art in the Kingdom of Benin took many forms, of which bronze and brass reliefs and the heads of kings and queen mothers are the best known. Bronze receptacles, bells, ornaments, jewellery, and ritual objects also possessed aesthetic qualities and originality, demonstrating the skills of their makers, although they are often eclipsed by figurative works in bronze and ivory carvings.[17]
In tropical Africa the technique of lost-wax casting was developed early, as the works from Benin show. When a king died, his successor would order that a bronze head be made of his predecessor. Approximately 170 of these sculptures exist, and the oldest date from the twelfth century.[18] The oba, or king, monopolized the materials that were most difficult to obtain, such as gold, elephant tusks, and bronze. These kings made possible the creation of the splendid Benin bronzes; thus, the royal courts contributed substantially to the development of sub-Saharan art.[19] In 1939, heads very similar to those of the Kingdom of Benin were discovered in Ife, the holy city of the Yoruba, which dated to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This discovery supported an earlier tradition holding that it was artists from Ife who had taught Benin the techniques of bronze metalworking.[20] Recognition of the antiquity of the technology in Benin advanced when these sculptures were dated definitively to that era.[21]
European interest and the Benin Expedition of 1897[edit]
Few examples of African art had been collected by Europeans in the eighteenth century. Only at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when colonization and missionary activity began, did larger numbers of African works begin to be taken to Europe, where they were described as simple curiosities of ""pagan"" cults. This attitude changed after the Benin Expedition of 1897.
In 1897, the vice consul general James Robert Phillips, together with six other British officials, two businessmen, translators, and 215 porters, set off toward Benin from the small port of Sapele, Nigeria.[8] Although they had given word of their intended visit, they were later informed that their journey must be delayed, because no foreigner could enter the city while rituals were being conducted;[23][24] however, the travellers ignored the warning and continued on their expedition.[25] They were ambushed at the south of the city by Oba warriors, and only two Europeans survived the ensuing massacre.[8][23]
News of the incident reached London eight days later and a naval punitive expedition was organized immediately,[8][23][25] which was to be directed by Admiral Harry Rawson. The expedition sacked and destroyed Benin City.[8][23] Following the British attack, the conquerors took the works of art decorating the Royal Palace and the residences of the nobility, which had been accumulated over many centuries. According to the official account of this event written by the British, the attack was warranted because the local people had ambushed a peaceful mission, and because the expedition liberated the population from a reign of terror.[23][26]
The works taken by the British were a treasure hoard of bronze and ivory sculptures, including king heads, queen mother heads, leopard figurines, bells, and a great number of images sculpted in high relief, all of which were executed with a mastery of lost-wax casting. In 1910, German researcher Leo Frobenius carried out an expedition to Africa with the aim of collecting works of African art for museums in his country.[27] Today perhaps as few as fifty pieces remain in Nigeria although approximately 2,400 pieces are held in European and American collections.[28]
Division among museums[edit]
The Benin Bronzes that were part of the booty of the punitive expedition of 1897 had different destinations: one portion ended up in the private collections of various British officials; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office sold a large number, which later ended up in various European museums, mainly in Germany, and in American museums.[7] The high quality of the pieces was reflected in the high prices they fetched on the market. The Foreign Office gave a large quantity of bronze wall plaques to the British Museum; these plaques illustrated the history of the Benin Kingdom in the fifteenth and sixteenth century.[26]
In 1984, Sotheby's auctioned a plaque depicting a musician. The value was estimated at between £25,000 and £35,000 in the auction catalogue.[26]

Subsequent sales and restitutions[edit]
The two largest collections of Benin Bronzes are located in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and in the British Museum in London, while the third largest collection is located in several museums in Nigeria (principally the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos).[31]
Since gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria has sought the return of these artefacts on several occasions.[31] The debate over the location of the bronzes in relation to their place of origin has been in contention. Often, their return has been considered an icon of the repatriation of the African continent. The artefacts have become an important example in the international debate over restitution, comparable to that of the Elgin Marbles.[32][33]
The British Museum sold more than 30 Benin Bronzes to the Nigerian government between 1950 and 1972. In 1950, the museum's curator Hermann Braunholtz declared that, although made individually, of the 203 plaques acquired by the Museum in 1898, 30 were duplicates; because they were identical representations, he determined that they were superfluous for the museum and were sold.[33] The sales stopped in 1972 and the museum's African art specialist said that they regretted the sales.[33]
In 2015, a Benin Bronze head was sold to a private collector for a record fee of £10m.[34][35]
In 2020, France approved the restitution of 26 items that had been pillaged in 1892.[36] In April 2021, the German government declared the restitution of looted Benin bronzes in Germany's public collections by 2022.[36] Hartmut Dorgerloh, the director of the Humboldt Forum, which incorporates the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, said at a press event that exhibiting the Benin bronzes in the new museum complex in Berlin as earlier planned is “now not imaginable”.[37]
The University of Aberdeen agreed in 2021 to return a bronze head of an oba, that had been purchased at an auction in 1957.[38][39]
The works[edit]
The Benin Bronzes are more naturalistic than most African art of the period. The bronze surfaces are designed to highlight contrasts between light and metal.[40] The features of many of the heads are exaggerated from natural proportions, with large ears, noses, and lips, which are shaped with great care.[41] The most notable aspect of the works is the high level of the great metal working skill at lost-wax casting. The descendants of these artisans still revere Igue-Igha, as the person who introduced the art of casting to the Kingdom of Benin.[40]
Another important aspect of the works is their exclusivity: property was reserved only for certain social classes, reflecting the strict hierarchical structure of society in the Kingdom of Benin. In general, only the king could own objects made of bronze and ivory, however, he could allow high-ranking individuals to use such items, such as hanging masks and cuffs made of bronze and ivory. Coral was also a royal material. Coral neck rings were a symbol of nobility and use was granted specifically by the Oba.[17]
Themes[edit]
The rectangular plaques exist in two formats. In one, the long vertical sides are turned back, creating a small edge that is decorated with an incised guilloche pattern. In the other format, which is much narrower, the turned-back edges are missing and the design of the plaque background ends abruptly, as if cut off. These variations probably reflect the size and shape of the palace pillars and the arrangement of the plaques on them. The plaques are generally about 1/8 inch thick.[15]
The backgrounds on the front of most of the plaques are incised with foliate patterns bearing one to four leaves, which is referred to as ebe-ame, or the ""river leaf"" design.[42] The leaves were used in healing rites by priestesses of Olokun, the god of the sea.[43]
Some of the reliefs represent important battles of the sixteenth-century wars of expansion, however, the majority depict noble dignitaries wearing splendid ceremonial dress. Most of the plaques portray static figures either alone, in pairs, or in small groups arranged hierarchically around a central figure. Many of the figures depicted in the plaques may be identified only according to their roles at court via their clothing and emblems, which indicated their function in the court, but not their particular historical identities. Although there have been attempts to link some of the depictions with historical figures, these identifications have been speculative and unverified. In certain cases, the lack of information even extends to the functional roles of some figures, which cannot conclusively be determined.[17]
The bronze heads were reserved for ancestral altars. They were also used as a base for engraved elephant tusks, which were placed in openings in the heads. The commemorative heads of the king or the queen mother were not individual portraits, although they show a stylized naturalism. Instead, they are archetypical depictions and the style of their design changed over the centuries, which also occurred with the insignias of the depicted royalty. The elephant tusks with decorative carvings, which may have begun being used as a decorative element in the eighteenth century, show distinct scenes from the reign of a deceased king.[17]
As a prerequisite for royal succession, each new Oba had to install an altar in honor of his predecessor. According to popular belief, a person's head was the receptacle of the supernatural guide for rational behavior. The head of an Oba was especially sacred, since the survival, security, and prosperity of all Edo citizens and their families, depended on his wisdom. In the annual festivals to reinforce the mystical power of the Oba, the king made ritual offerings in these sanctuaries, which were considered essential for the continuation of his reign. The stylistic variation of these bronze heads is such an important characteristic of Beninese art that it constitutes the principle scientific basis for establishing a chronology.[17]
The leopard is a motif that occurs throughout many of the Benin Bronzes, because it is the animal who symbolizes the Oba. Another recurring motif is the royal triad: the Oba in the centre, flanked by two assistants, highlighting the support of those in whom the king trusted in order to govern.[17]
According to some sources, the Benin artists may have been inspired by items brought during the arrival of the Portuguese, including European illuminated books, small ivory caskets with carved lids from India, and Indian miniature paintings. The quatrefoil ""river leaves"" might have originated from European or Islamic art,[15][42][44] but by contrast, Babatunde Lawal cites examples of relief carving in southern Nigerian art to support his theory that the plaques are indigenous to Benin.[45]
Technique[edit]
Although the works generally are called the Benin Bronzes, they are made of different materials. Some are made of brass, which metallurgical analysis has shown to be an alloy of copper, zinc, and lead in various proportions.[12] Others are non-metallic, made of wood, ceramics, ivory, leather, or cloth.[12]
The wooden objects are made in a complex process. It starts with a tree trunk or branch and is carved directly. The artist obtains the final form of the work from a block of wood. Since it was customary to use freshly cut wood in carvings, once the piece was finalized the surface was charred to prevent cracking during drying. This also allowed for polychromatic artworks, which were achieved using knife cuts and applications of natural pigments made with vegetable oil or palm oil. This type of grease, which was made near smoke from residences, allowed the wooden sculptures to acquire a patina that resembles rusty metal.[46]
The figures depicted in the bronzes were cast in relief with details incised in the wax model. Artists working in bronze were organized into a type of guild under royal decree and lived in a special area of the palace under the direct control of the Oba. The works made using lost-wax casting required great specialization. Their quality was superior when the king was especially powerful, allowing him to employ a great number of specialists.[47]
Although the oldest examples of similar Benin metal work in bronze date from the twelfth century, according to tradition, the lost-wax casting technique was introduced to Benin by the son of the Oni, or sovereign of Ife. Their tradition holds that he taught the Benin metal workers the art of casting bronze using lost-wax techniques during the thirteenth century.[48] These great Benin artisans refined that technique until they were able to cast plaques only an eighth-of-an-inch thick, surpassing the art as practiced by Renaissance masters in Europe.[40]
Reception[edit]
One sixteenth-century bronze, depicting the Oba with Europeans, was featured in A History of the World in 100 Objects, a series of radio programmes that started in 2010 as a collaboration between the BBC and the British Museum; it was also published as a book.[49]

23,Benin bronzes: The long journey home | Chatham House ...,https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2021-06/benin-bronzes-long-journey-home,"Over the years, the Benin bronzes, many of which are now housed in the British Museum and other European collections, have become a symbol of the broader restitution debate. More significant than items already returned to Africa, such as the Hendrik Witbooi Bible and whip, handed back to Namibia by a Stuttgart museum, or the Omar Tall sword returned to Senegal by France, they are a good starting point to discuss the issue of restitution.
Despite their popularity and the seemingly clear moral case for their return they represent only the very beginning of a long and complex journey to restitution.
The Benin bronzes – a catch-all term for items that include ivory, brass, bone and wood sculptures and carvings – were stolen. They are unquestionably precious to the world and cherished by their own people. This, together with the building of a new museum in Nigeria in which to house them, makes their return inevitable.
In 1897, the British sent 5,000 troops on a murderous march to the palace of Benin City, in what Peju Layiwola, the Nigerian artist and historian, calls the ‘Benin massacre’. They razed villages to the ground, killed thousands, sacked the palace and took everything, including 4,000 works of artistic, spiritual, medicinal and genealogical value. According to Zacharys Gundu, the archaeologist, they were taken to be sold in Europe ‘to pay for the expenses incurred in removing the king from his stool’.
Now Germany has said it will start to hand back to Nigeria priceless artefacts held in Berlin’s Ethnologisches Museum in 2022, following a similar move by France in 2020. In April 2021, the University of Aberdeen said it would repatriate a Benin bronze bought at an 1957 auction. Britain and the United States still retain hundreds of pieces.
The European importance of the bronzes lies primarily in their elegance. They hold a distinct visual power and have played a vital role in changing the assessment of intellectual, technological and artistic development of Africans.
The bronze works in particular are early examples of the complex lost-wax technique, displaying a technical mastery. Today, museums throughout the world value their technical and aesthetic brilliance.
When first encountered in 1910 by Leo Frobenius, the German ethnologist, they were said to be too ‘lovely’ to have been made by ‘this assembly of degenerate and feeble-minded posterity’.
The debate over the return of stolen artefacts currently centres on ‘experts’ from universities and museums in the global north. While they are vital to the debate, African voices are needed to bring balance. While African voices have been calling for the bronzes’ return since they were first taken, with the issue becoming most intense in the 1970s, increasingly they are speaking louder, and to each other, about what needs to be done.
Nana Oforiatta Ayim, the Ghanaian writer, art historian and filmmaker, has pointed to the absurdity of arguments that artefacts taken under colonial control but ‘paid for’ should not be considered as taken under duress.
The complex power frameworks that decide which artefacts are chosen for restitution are explored by Njoki Ngumi, the Kenyan activist and artist. She points out that the museums which often pick and choose for display from the masses of ‘things’ that were taken have themselves been unable to accurately catalogue, understand and care for the artefacts. Some remain in crates, unopened since they first arrived in the 20th century. Others have been ‘treated’ with arsenic and cannot be handled without protective clothing, she says.
Chao Tayiana Maina, the founder of African Digital Heritage, has worked to increase access to African cultural heritage. Her work reminds us that there are heaps of records, archives, fundamental knowledge of our history that remain locked away in European basements.
Wazi Apoh, the archaeologist and cultural heritage specialist, has written about what it will take to reclaim not just the physical, tangible objects, but the historical, spiritual and social knowledge around them that is vital to the restitution of African life.
For Felwine Sarr, the Senegalese academic, and Bénédicte Savoy, the French scholar on the provenance of looted art, restitution is not simply a question of ‘objects’ but a vital part of rewriting the ethical relationship between Europe and Africa, not just concerning the past but how they relate in the future.
‘Europe owes us the truth about what happened,’ says Achille Mbembe, the Cameroonian philosopher. ‘But you know, when you look at the history of our engagement with Europe, the one thing a lot of our thinkers and historians have found is that Europe has a serious problem with the truth.’
It is important that no one assumes that some ‘things’ can be returned and the book be simply closed on a chapter of difficult history. Instead, to return the artefacts is just the beginning of a process of restoration. To keep and learn from that which is returned – through academic research or even children’s education programmes – all requires substantial resources as well.
The imminent return of the Benin bronzes is a moment of celebration, yes. But it is also the first step on a long road of awkwardness, tumultuous emotions and complex accountability. We will need to remain committed to the process.

24,The missing Benin Bronzes - Prospect Magazine,https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/benin-bronzes-museum-west-africa-britain-colonialism-art,"The missing Benin Bronzes
More than a century ago, the Bronzes were taken by the British during a brutal colonial campaign in West Africa. Is it time they went back home?
On 29th December last year more than 200 posters were installed on bus stops and billboards across Dresden. Though they bore the word vermisst, they weren’t spreading the word about a missing person. Instead they featured five elaborate brass sculptures held in Dresden’s State Art Collections—objects taken from the Oba (king) of Benin in West Africa more than 120 years ago. The Nigerian artist Emeka Ogboh, who organised the poster campaign, tells me that he wanted to lend “the urgency and gravity of a public service announcement” to what has become a perennial debate in museum boardrooms across Europe and America.
The Benin Bronzes are an emblem of a wider discussion over the provenance of items from colonised nations that have ended up in the west. And the demand for their return is a cause célèbre for those who want to “decolonise” western culture. For those in charge of collections assembled during the imperial age, calls for restitution have become hard to ignore in the era of Black Lives Matter. But would returning the Bronzes truly right the wrongs of the past?
The term “Benin Bronzes” refers primarily to thousands of plaques, heads and animals cast in bronze, brass and copper using the finicky “lost wax” method that had been practised in the Kingdom of Benin since the 12th century. That kingdom—now part of Edo State in southern Nigeria—was one of Africa’s most powerful for 400 years.
That power came to a brutal end in February 1897, when the British deposed Oba Ovonramwen in a punitive expedition. Eight officers of the British Niger Coast Protectorate died; the number of Bini casualties was not accounted for, but perhaps four million bullets were used by the British. The action was justified as retaliation for the massacre of Captain James Phillips and his men a few months earlier; despite repeated warnings to stay away, they had sought an audience with the Oba during a sacred religious festival. But it was also the culmination of years of effort by the British Niger Coast Protectorate to undermine the Oba’s control over lucrative resources, such as palm oil. Today, the former British territory forms part of Nigeria. (The neighbouring country Benin, once the French colony of Dahomey, is a different place.) It is not known how many artworks were plundered by British soldiers back then, but one recent estimate puts the figure at 4,000. These are scattered across public and private collections around the world, including some 700 in the British Museum.
In Benin’s royal palaces, the artworks served many functions, both aesthetic and archival. In the Edo language, the verb “to remember” (sa-e-y-ama) translates literally as “to cast a motif in bronze.” The artist and writer Victor Ehikhamenor, who hails from Edo State, tells me that “it’s not just art for art’s sake. Cosmology, coronation processes, archiving of laws and ways of life—these plaques were ways of recording things, almost like photography, supplemented by oral narrative.”
Enotie Ogbebor, the son-in-law of prince Edun Akenzua of the Royal Court of Benin, asks me to “imagine that the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Delacroix, all the way to Picasso, Renoir and Monet—but also the works of Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare and Dante—were removed from western society and locked up for 100 years. Do you really think that western civilisation would be where it is now?”
When the artworks arrived in Europe they caused a sensation. Charles Read and Ormonde Dalton, keepers at the British Museum, noted their astonishment (in the racist language typical of the era) at finding Benin artists “using with familiarity and success a complicated method which satisfied the fastidious eye of the best artists of the Italian Renaissance.” The pieces were appreciated for their aesthetic value with little concern for what they meant in their original context, or for the manner in which they arrived.
After the initial spate of imperial triumphalism, the Benin expedition became blurred in the British memory amid countless other colonial campaigns. In 1964, future prime minister James Callaghan confessed he had never heard of it—even though his father had fought in it. Perhaps this historical amnesia goes some way to explaining why calls for the return of the Bronzes have been met with broad-brush replies: that any return would precipitate the emptying of western museums; that objects are better cared for in the west; that the world’s heritage belongs to a global audience, and so on.
But calls for the restitution of the Bronzes have a long and highly specific pedigree. Akenzua II, grandson of the deposed Oba Ovonramwen, lodged the first formal request for the return of two brass thrones in 1936. The director of the German State Museums replied at the time that he “was not prepared to give back or sell chairs of such high cultural value.” Another flashpoint came in 1977, when Lagos hosted the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture. A 16th-century ivory mask depicting Queen Idia, a renowned warrior and mother to Oba Esigie (who reigned from 1504 to 1550), was chosen as the symbol for the festival. But the British Museum claimed that this masterpiece was too fragile to travel.
In recent years, the debate has caught the attention of a wider global public. Movements such as Rhodes Must Fall have called for a reckoning, putting museums—often thought of as tranquil, fusty storehouses of cultural memory—in the frontline of the colonial history wars.
French president Emmanuel Macron sent shockwaves through the art world with a speech in Burkina Faso in 2017, in which he said restitution of African heritage was a “priority.” He commissioned a report, published the following year, from Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and French art historian Bénédicte Savoy. The authors called for a protocol to oversee the return of any objects in French museums looted from former colonies—a protocol that Macron has attempted to implement. In February this year, the Dutch government passed a similar resolution. In March, the German culture minister Monika Grütters called for “a national strategy” on restitution of German-held Benin Bronzes—including the “missing” Dresden sculptures.
In the UK, institutions as diverse as the University of Aberdeen, the Horniman Museum in London and the Church of England have all in recent months made strides towards returning Bronzes in their collections. There have been previous high-profile cases in the UK—notably that of Jesus College, Cambridge, which pledged to return a bronze cockerel, or okpa, after student pressure in 2016. However, such gestures are not looked on favourably by Boris Johnson’s government; the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has been trying to rein in the alleged “woke” tendencies of museums. It seems unlikely that the UK will follow its European neighbours in changing the strictures established in legislation such as the British Museum Act of 1963, which prevents trustees of the museum from being able to “sell, exchange, give away or otherwise dispose of any object vested in them and comprised in the Collection,” and so enable permanent restitutions from national collections.
Still, the debate is unlikely to calm down. In his new book The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution (Pluto), Dan Hicks, a curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Oxford, provides probably the most sustained attempt so far at setting out a theory for “decolonising the museum.” “Anthropology museums,” Hicks tells us, “are surely as significant a technology in the development of Victorian colonialism as the Maxim gun.” The latter enabled the subjugation not only of Benin City, but of many other societies across West Africa, a series of so-called “little wars” which, Hicks argues, in fact add up to a cohesive “World War Zero.” Hicks argues that the knowledge we gain from museums such as his own can only ever be a kind of “necrography”—offering a record only of the demise of a culture.
Hicks presents a moral binary that simplifies the issue. The Benin Bronzes themselves, though present in his subtitle, scarcely get a look-in as material and cultural artefacts. This failure to grapple with their specific case is more than a quibble over emphasis, for the Bronzes are atypical among African artworks. In basing the broader case for restitution of colonial-era objects on them alone, Hicks—like the French Sarr-Savoy report before him—misses some subtleties that are pertinent to any debate about decolonising culture.
“The Benin Bronzes have become an emblem of a wider discussion over the provenance of items from colonised nations”
Chief among these are the many less tangible forms of culture, which are still very much alive in Africa today. The headline-grabbing estimate used by Sarr-Savoy was that 90 to 95 per cent of material cultural heritage from Africa resides outside the continent. But this overlooks the rituals, songs and other art forms that both predate, and have developed since, the colonial era. Critics such as the curator Simon Njami have long argued that obsessing over the return of objects instils a Eurocentric ideology of valuing material heritage that is at odds with the way certain African cultures understand their history. And the movement of objects can change their meaning. For instance, masks that once had symbolic or spiritual power among the Fang communities of Gabon were stripped of this force when they were removed to the west. Returning such objects to the descendants of their makers would not undo the original theft—and seems scant reparation for the evils wrought with the Maxim gun.
Barnaby Phillips’s new book Loot: Britain and the Benin Bronzes (Oneworld) is considerably more persuasive. It casts the objects themselves as the protagonists of a lucid history. Phillips is scrupulously fair yet damning. He points to the racist hypocrisy that rationalised colonial plunder: laws that had been established in the wake of Napoleon’s invasions to outlaw spoliation applied only, in the words of the 1894 British War Office Manual of Military Law, to “warfare between civilised nations.” Phillips also covers the ritzy, often clandestine, history of the Bronzes on the western market, where some objects have been sold for up to £10m. Above all, his tale is one of competing ways of assessing material culture. In one telling anecdote, a visitor to the British Museum from Benin’s royal family provides “new information” to a curator who has studied the works for “much of her professional life.”
It was with precisely this kind of knowledge-exchange in mind that the Benin Dialogue Group (BDG) was established in 2010. It is a consortium of representatives from 11 European museums, as well the Nigerian National Commission for Monuments and Museums, the government of Edo State and the Benin royal family. Barbara Plankensteiner, director of the MARKK museum in Hamburg and a co-founder of the BDG, tells me that the group came about after an exhibition she curated in 2007 called “Benin: Kings and Rituals.”
Plankensteiner spent six years seeking scholarly input from the Benin royal family and other partners in Nigeria. But while the show travelled from Germany to Vienna and Chicago, all too typically, it did not stop in Benin.
“We felt that such an international and important project should have also taken place in Nigeria,” Plankensteiner says with regret. “We also felt particularly that we needed to do something about these sensitive and problematic collections in western museums. It’s a legacy that concerns all of us.”
Last year, the group announced plans for a new museum situated in the old Kingdom of Benin—the Edo Museum of West African Art. Designed by David Adjaye, it will feature a permanent but rotating installation of the Benin Bronzes, using loans from European museums, which the group claims will be “the most comprehensive” in the world. The British Museum is also helping to fund a £3m excavation of the site before building work commences.
In the same spirit, Digital Benin—a project spearheaded by Plankensteiner—will put a database of all known Bronzes online by 2022. Nicholas Thomas, director of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge, points to the ambition of the BDG to “drive quick action.” The loan agreement, he tells me, was something that “museum directors and curators had the authority to do,” without waiting for “trustees, city, state and national governments, in some cases changes of legislation.”
There are many Nigerians—Victor Ehikhamenor and Emeka Ogboh among them—for whom the idea of loans leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Wounds that have been open for more than a century will not heal easily, and the broader question of reparations remains live. But while European governments dither, the long-imposed obstacles to returning the lost pages of Benin history are being steadily removed.

The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution
A call for western museums to wash their hands of colonial blood
Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of brass plaques and carved ivory tusks depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.
The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museums, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.
Dan Hicks is Professor of Contemporary Archaeology at the University of Oxford and Curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum. His award-winning research focuses on the restitution of African cultural heritage from Euro-American collections, focusing on the place of ideas of cultural whiteness in ongoing histories of colonial violence.

'A startling act of conscience. An important book which could overturn what people have felt about British history, empire, civilisation, Africa, and African art. It is with books like this that cultures are saved, by beginning truthfully to face the suppressed and brutal past. It has fired a powerful shot into the debate about cultural restitution. You will never see many European museums in the same way again. Books like this give one hope that a new future is possible.' - Ben Okri

A Sussex auction house has withdrawn a Benin bronze from sale and the vendor will consider its repatriation to Nigeria after an expert raised concerns about its “uncertain” provenance.
Benin bronzes have been in the spotlight as calls mount for the return to Africa of thousands of examples looted in the sacking of Benin City by British forces in 1897. A number of UK museums have pledged to give back their bronzes or consider doing so.
The bronze, which had an estimate of £10,000-£15,000 at Burstow and Hewett Auctioneers, was described as “an extremely rare Benin bronze ancestral plaque, 16th/17th century, depicting three men, naked other than jewellery and hair ornamentation [with] finely incised tattoos”.

 Abstract   The article begins by discussing changing modes of display for non-Western visual cultures in Western museums, including Britain. Using the ‘Benin bronzes’ as a case study, the article argues for the existence of three distinct frameworks of display, linked to changing paradigms of art practice (broadly speaking, academic, modernist and postmodern/postcolonial). In the second part, the article moves on to discuss issues surrounding debates over the restitution of works held in Britain and elsewhere to their places of origin, again using the case of the Benin bronzes to focus broader questions. Finally, the discussion moves outwards to consider some of the implications for current debates about a ‘world art history’: arguing that this latter needs not only to guard against the prospect of a quasi-imperial expansion of current liberal notions of ‘art’, but, perforce, must also take account of contemporary practices, themselves critical of both academic and modernist conceptions of ‘art’.   Keywords:  world art history art and globalization Western and non-Western cultural patrimony display modernism 
 
 
 
 
   Introduction   This article was originally given as a paper to the conference of the Association of Art Historians at Manchester Metropolitan University in April 2009, as part of the strand ‘Art History and its Global Provinces’. I have retained its informal style in the present context. Despite its subtitle, the article is not ‘about’ the Benin bronze sculptures and plaques that were made in Benin City in West Africa between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. There is a specialist art historical literature on the royal art of Benin as well as an equally specialized challenge to the assumptions of that literature.   1    I am not a specialist in the art of Benin, or African art more generally. Instead, this paper emerges from a set of interests that are simultaneously more general and more local in character, concerning the relation of the Western canon of art to ‘elsewhere’ and to the display of art from ‘elsewhere’ in British museums.     Display   As part of my university's official commitment to ‘diversity’, and also as a contribution to broadening the art history curriculum, an inter-disciplinary study of the ‘Benin bronzes’ (more accurately they are cast brasses) was recently included in the Open University course ‘The Arts Past and Present: An Introduction to the Humanities’. I was one of four authors. The material covered included, as well as the facture of the cast bronzes/brasses and related carved ivories from the same approximate period, historical trading relations between Europe and West Africa, the British invasion of the kingdom of Benin in 1897 and the complexities of the subsequent reception of the sculptures into Britain and Europe around the turn into the twentieth century. My own contribution discussed the cast sculptures and plaques in relation to the avant-garde discourse of primitivism, its subsequent eclipse and continuing present-day problems of reception in a period of globalization.   2       Coincidentally, 2007 and 2008 also happened to be the occasion for the largest exhibition of the art of Benin yet assembled.   3    That travelling exhibition did not visit London, where the British Museum has one of the world's largest holdings of Benin art. It was, however, seen at three major European museums, the Völkerkunde museum in Vienna, the musée du Quai Branly in Paris and the Ethnologisches museum in Berlin. Its final destination was across the Atlantic at the Art Institute in Chicago. It did not, you will notice, travel to Nigeria. This is a point to which we shall return.   Although the British Museum (BM) was not on the itinerary of the 2007–8 exhibition, the BM's display of African cultural materials condenses many of the issues to be discussed here, and testifies to the fluid, not to say confusing situation obtaining in the exhibition of world arts. Parts of the BM display include anonymously made utilitarian objects arranged according to material in the manner of a traditional museum of anthropology. The Sainsbury-sponsored Africa Galleries, which opened in 2001,   4    are as a whole dedicated to the memory of the English sculptor Henry Moore, including a statement at the entrance by Moore himself on the expressive power of the formal distortions practised by African carvers; that is to say, a paradigmatically modernist reading of African art. Still other parts display pieces by individual contemporary artists, including Magdalene Odundo and El Anatsui. An installation by Sokari Douglas Camp overtly seeks to counter a formalist-modernist reading of masks on display nearby and to re-embed them in social practices of masquerade. The BM Benin display itself straddles all three modes. The well-known Queen Mother head and many other free-standing objects are conventionally displayed in glass cases. A selection of the unique two-dimensional plaques are, however, arranged in a grid format attached to vertical steel poles – a design which manages simultaneously to allude to the original presentation of the plaques on the pillars of the Oba's palace in Benin City and to connote a minimalist-grid cum contemporary-art installation in which the balance of display tilts decisively from the ethnographic to the aesthetic. Elsewhere contemporary popular-cultural textiles reference a range of issues from sports to politics to anti-Aids campaigns, and in so doing pose further challenges to entrenched art/craft, high/low distinctions. These local contradictions within the BM's Africa Galleries are part of a wider instability in the museum display of such work. It is, moreover, an instability with a history.   One of the most persistent difficulties attendant on the field of ‘world art’ – particularly pre-modern world art – and Western displays of it, concerns precisely the ‘art’ status of the work on show. This is not because of any doubts about estimation and ranking in the here and now (whether status X should or should not be conferred on object Y), but because of the history of the term itself.   As late as 1857 Ruskin could claim there was no ‘pure and precious ancient art’ in Asia, Africa or America, thereby centring the term ‘art’ on the European tradition. This is not to say that Ruskin thought that Islamic, Chinese and Indian civilizations lacked art as such (indeed he remarks elsewhere in the same lecture that ‘nearly every great and intellectual race of the world’ has produced an art particular to it).   5    But it places him in a tradition which systematically disparaged the products of such cultures relative to Europe; and indeed, in the case of other places such as Oceania, North America and Africa, he did actually consider them to be devoid of ‘art’. Far from being exceptional, such a position was normative in the mid-nineteenth century. Yet that position had already undergone radical revision before the end of that century within the emerging avant-garde. There at least, attention quite suddenly shifted from the post-Renaissance academic tradition and its Antique predecessor, the centre ground of the preceding 400 years of ‘art’, to the hitherto disparaged ‘outside’. Initially, Japanese cultural products, especially prints, became thought of as ‘art’, on a par with if not superior to the erstwhile Western canon. Thus the Goncourt brothers wrote in their  Journal  in 1862 that: ‘Art is not one, or rather there is no single art. Japanese art is as great as Greek art.’   6    And, most resoundingly, the hitherto disparaged products of Oceania and Africa moved from the category ‘ethnographic artefact’ to the new category ‘primitive art’. In the early twentieth century the modernist idea of art became established as a universal category anchored in a notion of transcultural, transhistorical, ‘significant form’. In Clive Bell's famous list of 1914 it could include the medieval stained glass windows of Chartres, a Mexican sculpture, a Persian bowl, a Chinese carpet, the dome of Sta Sophia, as well as a fourteenth-century fresco by Giotto and a then almost contemporary oil painting by Cézanne.   7       Once modernism in its turn came to be regarded as a local tradition, the tradition of the West, ‘art’ remained a concept of global application, defined now, however, not in terms of its unity or its purity, its grounding in an essentialistically conceived ‘form’, but in terms of its endless difference: Indian art, African art, Inuit art, Aztec art, Ottoman art, Paleolithic art, as well as European art; not to mention contemporary globalized art tied to no particular regional tradition (or to many).   This development, beyond formalist modernism, represents as significant a shift as does the earlier one from narrative into form. It is far from being a simple case of accretion around a stable core, because, while in one sense the ‘art’ status of an open range of practices and products (bottle racks, beds and bodies  inter alia ) has come to be accepted as secure, that security is weakened by deeper uncertainty about the core concept itself. This is a dilemma whose familiarity does nothing to cancel its force: if anything, everything and nothing can count as ‘art’, what has happened to the grounds of value (use value and exchange value alike) on which the concept has been and continues to be predicated?   This has taken me far beyond the modest introduction I intended, and much in the foregoing is compressed and scarcely adequate to the complexity of the subject. But, in the present compass, all I am trying to establish is this: that, set against the grounding context of a discourse of artistic modernism over the last 150–200 years (its emergence, its establishment and its transformation), there have been three distinct paradigms under which ‘non-Western’ culture was received and displayed in the ‘West’. I am using this problematic binary deliberately here. For what we know of binaries is that they privilege one term over the other, where the latter term is instantly inscribed as the lack of the former. The binary in play here is of course a large part of the point at issue: the ‘non-Western’ being ‘received and displayed’ in the ‘West’. The implicit power relations within that sentence constitute the hidden seven-eighths of the iceberg of ‘art’ in modernity.   The first display paradigm was of the object regarded as anthropological artefact. The purpose here is to provide knowledge of exotic or alien ways of life. Such displays are constructed under the sign of ‘science’. They are, or perhaps I should say, were, intended to communicate knowledge, anthropological or ethnographic knowledge. As long as ‘art’ was identified with classical and post-Renaissance mimesis these kinds of thing were not regarded as art. Repulsive or fascinating, it makes no difference; skilful, ingenious, they may have been, startling examples of ‘native’ craft they may have been, but ‘fine art’ they were not.   The second display paradigm reflects a revolution. That system of values (and here I am repeating some of what I have already said), undergoes a significant transformation owing to the beliefs and practices of the avant-garde of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the words of Meyer Schapiro, ‘what was once considered monstrous, now become pure form and pure expression’.   8    For the avant-garde it was precisely the products of the academic tradition that lost their virtue, becoming seen as compromised by their complicity in the wider values of bourgeois culture. For them, value migrates to marginalized, disregarded, subordinate practices of representation. These included, as well as the hinterlands of the canon itself, such as Dutch art, the register of the popular, notably prints such as those from Epinal, and later the press and advertising. Also numbered among these new sources of value were the representational practices of the rest of the world, including the colonies. For the avant-garde, the most significant of these, in more or less chronological order, were Japan, the South Pacific and Africa. Modernism constructs the category ‘Primitive Art’, determined principally by concepts of ‘form’ and ‘expression’, fuelling the core value of ‘autonomy’. Resulting displays were organized under the sign of the aesthetic. Historical examples are multiple, the key period being the half century from Alfred Barr's pioneering MoMA exhibitions of the mid-1930s to the late, and hence controversial, instance of William Rubin's MoMA exhibition of 1984.   9    From more recent times, displays continuing that lineage albeit in modified form, might include the Pavilion des Sessions at the Louvre, with its ‘one hundred works of exceptional quality’;   10    in terms of the Benin bronzes, the 2007 Quai Branly display and the permanent display of the Benin plaques in the Africa Galleries at the BM.   Then a third display paradigm duly emerged, under the pressure of broader, world-historical forces, namely de-colonization and globalization, as well as more localized pressure. Increasingly, in the last quarter of the twentieth century the translation of the non-Western into the terms of a Western aesthetic under the universalizing rubrics of form and expression came under attack as part of the wider critical and art-historical move against the precepts of orthodox ‘modernism’ mounted by the so-called ‘new art history’. In some respects this emergent third paradigm marks the return of the repressed anthropological moment, as it were, at a higher level. Here the re-emergence of social-ethnographic considerations marks not a refusal to confer the elevated status of art on the artefacts of exotic cultures, but a challenge to the modernist autonomy claim in the name of a putatively expanded field of art. From this perspective, the work of art is now regarded less as an object of attention in its own right, as if it were an end in itself, and more as a means of engaging with the culture of the Other – other  people . These displays are constructed under the sign of difference, under the sign of identity politics, wherein it is not aesthetic autonomy that is held to be the governing virtue, but cultural diversity and the relation of art to ways of life.   In terms of the travelling Benin exhibition of 2007–8 these display paradigms were differentially registered in Vienna, Berlin and Paris. In Vienna a facsimile of the wall of the royal palace in Benin City was constructed to frame the entrance to the otherwise conventional display of objects, thus rooting the displays in a specific history; a similar thing was done with a facsimile altar, again siting the objects in a simulacrum of their original meaning-conferring locale. The final rooms of the Vienna installation and the entrance of the Berlin installation adopted the opposite tactic: of relating the displays of historical objects to a contemporary conjuncture. In the Vienna display, the historical works were related to contemporary Nigerian popular culture – fabrics, calendars and late twentieth-century bronzes – some replicating traditional motifs, some inaugurating new ones. In the Berlin display, the history was connected to the contemporary Nigerian diaspora in Europe, in the form of life-size photographs and accompanying interviews with Edo people resident in Berlin. Both Vienna and Berlin differed significantly from Paris, which had none of this. There the relief plaques in particular were separated from the artefacts, individually lit and in effect displayed as two-dimensional works of art, like paintings (or, indeed, like a postmodernist Parthenon frieze).   In the terms I have established, then, the Paris display represented a combination of the first and second paradigms of display (historical artefacts separated out from works of art, the latter presented as aesthetic objects in their own right, and a  de facto  exclusion of contextualizing objects or information which was regarded as detracting from the impact of the works of art, as art). The Vienna and Berlin installations in their different ways represented a mix of the first and third modes (vestiges of the display of anthropological artefacts transfigured into art and embedded in a contemporary acknowledgment of cultural difference). For its part, the BM Africa Gallery combines all three display paradigms: a relatively traditional ethnographic display, a modernist display geared to maximum aesthetic impact and more contemporary preoccupations with cultural diversity evidenced in displays of masquerade and ephemera. A further and yet more radically ‘embedded’ account within the scope of the third paradigm can be found in the permanent display of Benin art at the Horniman Museum in south London. Curated not by an English but by a Nigerian guest curator (subsequently Director of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments), this display both frames the plaques as aesthetic objects and situates them in a cultural web, secured both by a connected video of contemporary bronze production in Benin City and captioning in the Edo language, with the Edo title placed above the English ‘translation’ – as well as a panel of interpretation derived from Edo oral history.   11       In the wake of the ‘expanded field’ of the post-Second World War neo-avant-garde, conceptual art, and finally global postmodernism, institutions both temporary and permanent, such as Documenta and Tate Modern, have little or no difficulty displaying contemporary Chinese or African art alongside installations of Western equivalents. The key antecedent here, for all its undoubted problems, was  Magiciens de la terre  of 1989.   12    The parity continues with an exhibition such as  Africa Remix  at the Hayward Gallery.   13    This is all now unproblematic, marking a considerable shift from the disputes only twenty years ago around  The Other Story  exhibition, which now read like bulletins from a bygone age.   14    In this respect contemporary cultural globalization may be said to solve its own problems (even as it creates others: the unscrupulous exploitation of ‘indigenous’ markets being one such).   The situation with the display of non-Western  pre -modern artefacts as art is more tensioned. After much controversy the Louvre does have the annexe, or perhaps it should be the ghetto, of the Pavilion des Sessions, though the Louvre is anyway a sort of combination of the National Gallery and the BM. In England we have yet to see the Benin bronzes in the National Gallery, though the Royal Academy regularly hosts temporary exhibitions of non-Western art (Africa; Aztec Mexico; Japanese prints, to name only three of the most prominent) in the same galleries it uses on other occasions to show contemporary art. The Victoria & Albert Museum, rooted in the 1851 Exhibition, does display non-Western material, albeit under the rubric of the ‘decorative arts’. The BM of course, also shows non-Western cultures, though as we have seen, it is not always clear whether the work is shown as art, artefact or craft, and there is an audible grinding of gears when contemporary art by individuated artists is displayed alongside the historical collection. Unlike the Louvre, the BM never displays anything from the core Western canon of ‘art’; that is not its purpose. That is the purpose of the National Gallery … And so on … The boundaries are fluid, as between conceptions of ‘fine art’ and ‘the lesser arts’, as well as between the canonical art of the West and historically extra-canonical art from elsewhere around the globe. Museological display solutions are ad hoc. The category ‘art’ expands and contracts according to fashion and the motive of the curator, and there is a sense that everyone ‘knows what it really means’ anyway … Which is another way of saying that, conceptually, it is all rather a mess. This is one reason why an analysis of display is so important. Bricks and mortar, real spaces, have a way of dramatizing the contradictions and assumptions that run below the surface of art historical debate about ‘world art’.   15         Restitution   The Berlin Benin display contained a documentary section on the events of 1897: blown-up photographs and illustrations from the  Illustrated London News  of subjects such as the British column advancing into Benin territory and the so-called crucifixion trees. There was also in this section a curious, military-grey painted panel with a slit, like a peep-hole into a cell, or the view from a pill-box. Which in effect is what it was. The view through the slit revealed one of the 1897 photographs of British soldiers sitting inside the palace compound surrounded by dozens of brass and ivory objects, plaques, figures and carved tusks roughly laid out on the ground.   This is the moral heart of the Benin art issue. It is the brute fact that stands behind all those modes of display, as anthropological artefact, as primitive art, as token of cultural difference.   16    It is how the objects got to be displayed in the first place, in London, Berlin or Vienna. It is their defining moment, the moment of their theft, and the moment, as it were, of their symbolic death within one form of life. It is also, of course, the moment of their emergence onto a world stage, and of their rebirth into another form of life. It is the moment of their passage from religion into art.   Unlike many similarly notorious cases, including the Parthenon marbles, there are no grey areas, no dubious contracts, no questions about whether those who were doing the selling knew what they were parting with. The Benin bronzes were stolen pure and simple. Or, rather, they were appropriated as war booty – and not for their intrinsic interest as art or any other thing, but in order to defray the costs of the punitive expedition, including support for the dependants of British casualties. They were not taken  for  the BM they were sold  to  the museum and similar institutions and private collectors through the medium of commercial dealers.   When we produced our Open University course, in the year of the bicentennial of the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, the question of the ownership of the Benin bronzes, and whether they should or should not return to West Africa, was one issue that could not be avoided. The way we addressed this was to present two voices, each putting one side of the case, and let the students make up their own minds. The two voices were those of a black British artist and curator from Manchester, Kevin Dalton Johnson, and a white curator from the African department of the BM, Christopher Spring.   The question of the restitution of the Benin bronzes is one of those that seem simple at first glance but become very complicated the further one investigates. It is also highly emotive. Our speaker who favoured the return of the bronzes eloquently linked their theft to imperialism and slavery, which he described as ‘the African Holocaust’. He made the return of the sculptures to Nigeria a test case of international equality, and for him any counter-argument was tantamount to an endorsement of inequality and as such a symptom of continuing imperialism.   17    From that point of view, the sculptures were stolen and they should be returned to their rightful owners; while in the West, whether in private collections or in public museums, they are de facto hostages, severed from the cultural context that gives them meaning. This extends to the issue of the objects' safety. To question the ability of Nigerian museums to protect them is to question the ability of Africans to manage themselves, and is as such symptomatic of continuing, albeit disguised, racism. Such arguments are also widely rehearsed on the Internet, notably in the publications of Kwame Opoku, and were the substance of MP Bernie Grant's campaign, around the time of the centenary of the looting of the bronzes, for the Africa Reparations Movement. They continue to attract widespread support.   The other side of the argument is most publicly identified with the Director of the BM, Neil MacGregor and James Cuno, the Director of the Art Institute of Chicago. The nub of the argument is that the ‘universal’ or ‘encyclopaedic’ museum represents an Enlightenment project to preserve and display the manifold cultures of the human race for humanity as a whole, now and in the future; that such institutions do the best job of looking after them that can be done and that they have a responsibility to generations as yet unborn to do so. It will be seen that two themes are intermingled here: on the one hand an argument about security and safety; on the other a more complex moral argument about the question of ‘cultural patrimony’, about rights of ownership and about cultural nationalism as contrasted with humanity in a more universal sense. In addition to those already cited, the most nuanced discussion of these issues that I know can be found in the writing of the Ghanaian-American philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.   18       The moral weight of the argument for restitution seems formidable. The Benin bronzes are stolen goods, their original meanings were embedded in the cultural and religious practices of Benin. It is a short step from there to argue that to display them in Western museums either as cultural artefacts or even as works of art, is to denature them, to trivialize them and to truncate their significance. At first glance, the counter argument seems shaky by comparison. Even if it is true that the objects are secured for the future by the conservation practices of the great museums, the Enlightenment-inspired claim that they are preserving culture for all of humanity is compromised by the power relations that subtend this situation. In a word, they are all in the West. There is a chasm between the ‘is’ and the ‘ought’. And the chasm is filled with the toxic waste of slavery, racism, imperialism, the detritus of history-as-nightmare. In such a situation it is difficult if not impossible to arrive at a ‘balanced’ assessment of the arguments. History obtrudes, and inescapably frames the meanings of the objects.   19       A more general issue, which forms a kind of backdrop to all these arguments, is the matter of identity politics. Our speaker in favour of restitution, himself a black British artist of Jamaican parents, felt able to speak throughout in the first person plural. From his position, it simply does not matter that he has never been to Africa, or indeed that on his one visit to Jamaica he was subject to criticism from locals for being ‘British’. ‘We’ means ‘black’ and being black enables him to speak with authority, as a representative of those who have been robbed, on the question of the restitution of important cultural property. From that position, this identification overrides all other arguments and counterarguments, and has the further effect of rendering counterarguments hollow, even before they are articulated. They implicitly become excuses for the concealed interests of a different and undeclared set of identifications – principally ‘white’ and ‘colonialist’, which are held to subtend the speaker's discursive arguments whether he or she is aware of it or not.   Clearly this is only to begin to raise a far-reaching question. Even to articulate it raises the temperature, and to investigate it fully would take us far beyond the scope of the present article. I want to short-circuit the discussion by saying that I agree with Suman Gupta's argument that it is possible to retain a conception of identity as socially constructed, that is to continue to resist an essentialist politics of identity, and yet to reject an identity politics according to which, to choose the most obvious examples, women and non-Western people have privileged positions on questions concerning the lived experiences of gendered and raced or ethnic being-in-the-world. That is to state the matter too crudely, but for present purposes it serves as a marker. All I shall do at this point is echo Gupta's argument in his study, to the effect that, while the institutionalization of social constructionist identity politics in literary studies and other humanistic and social sciences disciplines ‘has been an enlightening and expansive process in some respects, it has also emphatically been one that has spread limits and constraints … curtailing free debate and exchange in significant ways’. In contrast, Gupta has argued that:   Any expression of a political position … is open to critical engagement and debate by anyone, anywhere … It does not matter who (as a gendered body) [and of course this goes also to questions of race and ethnicity] is articulating or acting in this political arena; all that matters is what basis of integrity, knowledge and understanding, and emotional investment (by a critical and communicative agent) is being brought to the arena.   20           As I say, this is an issue with too many ramifications to resolve here, but to state it is a necessary prelude to the next part of my discussion, or perhaps I should say to the next episode of the story I am telling. I am not naive enough to believe that first-hand experience is going to cut through this Gordian knot; experience, we know, is always mediated. There is no straight way through this thicket. There appears to be a gulf between an unanswerable moral case – the return of stolen goods – and an undeniable fact that, at the present historical point, objects including the Benin bronzes are physically safer in institutions such as the BM than they would be in a comparable institution in Nigeria. Actually, I do not feel that the opposition is quite so simple. I think the really difficult problems are not between facts and values, but are squarely located in the field of values themselves, in arguments about cultural patrimony, nationalism and identity politics. But at that point, in 2008, I still had a blind spot for which no amount of intellectual debate seemed able to compensate. Reading arguments by museum people and critics such as Sally Price and Charles Gore, Neil MacGregor or James Cuno, or the artist Peju Layiwola or the philosopher Anthony Appiah, could not make up for the fact that I had never been to Africa. I am aware that ‘seeing for yourself’ has little currency in certain parts of academe. But for better or for worse I could not help feeling that in a matter of this kind, something about weighing the pros and cons in books, or even in seminar rooms and lecture theatres here in Britain, is lacking. There is a long tradition of this kind of thing, of course. Winckelmann never went to Greece, Arthur Waley never went to China. But, in my impasse, I felt I had to go to Nigeria, to Benin in fact. It might not help (and in the end I am not sure it did). But still I had to. However undecided I might remain, intellectually, politically and morally, I felt that something attaching to the experience of being in those places and talking to people there might at least put some foundation under my uncertainty that would be lacking otherwise.   So I went. I visited the National Museum in Lagos. I visited the National Museum in Benin City. I visited the brass casters district there, now designated a Unesco World Heritage site. I spoke to artists and academics in Benin and presented a research seminar at the University of Lagos. These experiences add up to a story in themselves, though it is one that I must leave aside for now. Nigeria is a powerful and vibrant country, but it presents difficulties for a stranger. It is difficult to get to and it is difficult to get around without help, even with the greatest hospitality and practical assistance it is possible to provide. Nigeria is potentially a rich country, but actually a poor one. Partly this is to do with deep-rooted corruption within the political system. Partly it is to do with the effects of the IMF Structural Adjustment programmes which have enforced privatization on the economy. That is to say, the West is not without responsibility for the state of the country.   Given that background, it is not surprising that the state of the National Museum in Lagos leaves much to be desired, or that the condition of the provincial museum in Benin City is worse. An enormous injection of funds would be the precondition for even beginning to reach a level of facilities commensurate with the most unmodernized museum in Europe or North America. Sad as it may be, that is the reality of the situation. None of the criteria of security or preservation raised by the arguments about the universal museum can be met. I take that as an unhappy fact. What is at issue is whether it matters. While I was there I was told that the Ford Foundation was engaged in the early stages of a proposal to renovate the National Museum to the tune of tens of millions of US dollars. Personally I would have thought the US would have to spend what it has been spending on its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to even begin to make museum facilities and infrastructure in Lagos of a standard comparable to the norm in Europe. Hopefully work on this scale will happen in the future. In the wake of the current technological revolution Nigeria will eventually become prosperous and a museum like the Acropolis museum in Athens will emerge. At the present time, we are not in that situation.   One of the things I found most interesting was that, in discussing the issue of ‘restoration’ in the here and now, there were different positions evident within Nigeria as well as here in Britain. In the discussion following my talk at the University of Lagos, there is no question that there was a basic sympathy for the project of returning the Benin bronzes to Nigeria and a justifiable prickliness about their retention by Western museums. But there were different inflections to people's concerns. I will try to discuss two of them.   Here is the contribution by Professor Rufus T. Akinyele, an historian and at that point the acting Dean of the Faculty of Arts:   This isn't a question as such, it might be a way of finding some kind of compromise between the two views. Looking at the issue of restitution, and whether to retain the works of art in Europe or whether to bring them back home – I am not trying to turn back the hands of the clock, but when we repatriate these works of ours, are we sure they are not going to find their way back [i.e. to Europe] through illegal means? We also want these things to be shown to the outside world. But one thing I also know is that where they are now, these works of art are busy generating funds for different countries. It is possible to assess, say for the last ten years, how many people have visited the British Museum – and on the basis of that you can work out a formula … you can do the ratio – two to three or whatever – you allow them to take a percentage and then you repatriate a percentage back to the source, to their original homeland. In that case we shall be happy. They will be staying where they are, but we are also getting something in return.   21           Professor Akinyele seems to acknowledge the problem of corruption and the black market in stolen antiquities. He thus argues not for a return of the objects themselves so much as for a share of the income derived from their display abroad to be reimbursed to their place of origin, as a form of investment in Nigerian art and culture. A minor but not insignificant point is that the professor seems not to acknowledge that entrance to the BM is free. He believes that a proportion of the entrance fees can be repaid to the country of origin. Whereas precisely this is, of course, one of MacGregor's main points: entry is free. Or, at least, and this would be a Nigerian point, it is free to anyone who has managed to get to England. But Professor Akinyele's oversight is a small one. Some recompense along those lines could and should be made. Now. In the fullness of time, when Nigeria is open and prosperous and home to high-standard museums, surely some kind of circulating system of the sculptures should operate. In the meantime the provision of direct financial recompense (in addition to other long-term work by Western museums in developing museums and cultural practices in Africa, which are extensive and continuous) seems a modest and justified demand.   Nonetheless, a very different and more radical point of view was passionately argued by Dr Bruce Onobrakpeya, one of Nigeria's most senior artists and cultural ambassadors:   The other thing I want to talk about is this ‘restitution’. I take the position of the monarch of Benin. He wants this art to be brought back because they are not just mere ‘things’. They are things that reflected the history and reflected the culture, reflected the religion; and where there was writing in the West, this art stood for writing, stood for the collective memory of the people. Now when you think of them this way, they show the young people who are being born, who have no access to the knowledge that has been recorded by the older people, the older generation, and so they are not able to grow as fast as they should have done. So I take the position of the monarch – Bring these artworks back!       For Dr Onobrakpeya, the situation is different from that of Professor Akinyele. As far as he is concerned, the sculptures have their cultural meaning in the religious ceremonies of the court of Benin. They are stripped of those meanings when they are kept elsewhere. And, no less importantly, the cultural life of the people of Benin is impoverished by their absence. For those reasons, the sculptures should be returned now. I think this argument is very powerful. And, I have to say, it splits me down the middle. In some ways the simplest response would be to accede to it and have done. It is logically straightforward, it is ethically forceful indeed and it regards people as more important than objects.   So why do I find myself hesitating before it? I think I have two types of reason. One concerns a conception of culture and society, the other concerns a conception of art. As I understand it, the present King of Benin is the descendant of absolute monarchs, and no royal palace in history has been a democratic institution. I feel it is important to distinguish between arguments about returning the bronzes to public museums in Nigeria and returning them to the royal palace for use in religious ceremonies. Historians of Nigeria and Benin, including John Picton and Charles Gore, have argued that the prevailing history of the Benin royal dynasty is far from the long-running legitimacy of the widely promulgated image.   22    It represents a form of hegemony that conceals both ruptures in the dynastic succession itself (including client status to the British before independence) and the existence and legitimacy of other more popular cultural-religious practices within the wider society of Benin (before colonization, during it and since independence).   For my part I am a secular post-Enlightenment European intellectual and I have no wish to bolster royal power anywhere. This obviously brings up further arguments about cultural imperialism, cultural pluralism, the imposition of Western models, in short questions of power relations and legitimacy. Some convoluted questions ensue. As a republican in England am I committed on anti-colonialist grounds to support the claims of a monarch in Africa? Am I, by resisting the claims of an African monarch, perpetuating the power relations of British imperialism? Whatever labyrinths these questions subtend, and whatever monsters lurk in them, my belief at this time is that I do not want works of art to be removed from public view, from public accessibility, whatever the nature of claims about the matrix of beliefs and practices whence they historically emerged. I would feel exactly the same about a work of Christian religious art being removed from the National Gallery and placed in an Italian monastery or about the portrait of a Spanish king being removed from the same museum and hung in a Spanish royal palace of the present day. That said, it must also be acknowledged that ‘public accessibility’ is relative. As Dr Onobrakpeya himself forcefully, and rightly, argued – in the contemporary condition of ‘Fortress Europe’, let alone within the prevailing conditions of global wealth distribution, the collections of the BM and similar institutions can scarcely be claimed to be ‘accessible’ to Africans.   Accepting that important qualification, my response goes to a set of post-Enlightenment more or less socialistic beliefs about power and the public sphere. Yet it also goes to a second set of concerns, about a particular conception of art. These I want to try and discuss in a separate and final section.   But first I have to try to clarify my position on the demand for restitution. I have already said that I have misgivings about removing the bronzes from an art context and resituating them in a less than fully public, potentially exclusive social context oriented around religious practice and the exercise of political power. But the question of restitution into a museum situation in either Benin or Lagos is substantially different. As I see it, the moral case is in principle unanswerable, whereas the practical situation is very different. I say ‘in principle’, but I do not think that principle extends to the removal of all Benin works to Nigeria any more than it would make sense to return all Impressionist paintings to France. I think what I think is this. At present little can be done: the existing museums are dilapidated and any works returned would be at risk (though financial recompense is another matter). If, however, the Ford Foundation plan materializes over the next few years I should have thought there was an unanswerable case for the BM to contribute sufficient works from its enormous Benin holdings (only a small proportion of which are actually on display in the BM) to enrich any new displays in the National Museum in Lagos as part of the planning of that museum. This would at least disperse some of the bad feeling engendered by the BM's refusal to lend the famous Benin ivory mask to the Festac exhibition in 1977. This was still a  cause célèbre  in the debate following my paper at the University of Lagos in October 2008, and regarded as evidence of Western bad faith (despite the BM's repeated claim that the loan was refused on conservation grounds). More than that, I would say there should be some symbolic transfer of ownership of the Benin works back to the Nigerian state (not to the monarch of Benin) with the concession of permanent loan to London (or elsewhere) of the works required for display there. In time, when Nigeria has become more stable politically and economically, I would hope for a system of exchanges between those Western museums that currently have Benin holdings and new museums in Nigeria, on an equal footing. There is, after all, enough to go round; and it is important to reiterate that the works – any works – ultimately ‘belong’ to humankind rather than to a transient state apparatus.     ‘World art history’?   I will return now to the question of ‘art’, and to the second of my reservations about Dr Onobrakpeya's argument. It has been claimed, with considerable justification I would say, that in art history today there is no more pressing question than that of ‘world art’. I want to use this section of my article to try to tie together some loose ends which remain from the foregoing discussions of ‘display’ and ‘restitution’.   It is widely acknowledged that the modern system of the arts came into being in the eighteenth century.   23    Although Paul Oskar Kristeller's argument has been reopened to contemporary debate, for present purposes I am accepting that when we talk about ‘art’ we are not talking about a natural category, that we are certainly not talking about a category with a fixed, unchanging, transhistorical or transgeographical essence, but about category with a history. The history with which I am concerned, moreover, is a history articulated in Europe. Practices of an art-like nature, for want of a better way of putting it, symbolic practices with an aesthetic dimension, have existed throughout human history, in all times and in all places. This is not quite the same as saying that ‘art’ has always existed. By ‘art’ we have come to mean something historical and particular.   If this seems merely to be a case of semantics, of wantonly making things difficult for ourselves, I shall try to clarify the point. When we talk of ‘Ancient Egyptian art’, we are not saying that the ancient Egyptians had a concept of art at one with that which provides the criteria for, let us say, inclusion at this year's Venice Biennale; that there is an enduring concept which has persisted ever since, from the former to the latter, underlying all the vagaries of actual expression. That would be to claim that art is indeed the kind of transhistorical essence we have already agreed it is not. What I think we are doing when we refer to ‘Ancient Egyptian art’ (and here I follow John Baines) is, first, to acknowledge that in ancient Egypt there was a practice of wall decoration, statue-making, etc., which was not completely and in its entirety client to the dictates of religion and secular power. Second, it is to acknowledge that that practice developed its own codes and traditions and conventions, what Baines calls its ‘decorum’, that distinguished it from the practice of religion and politics.   24    In a word it enjoyed relative autonomy. What we are doing then, when we refer to ‘Ancient Egyptian art’, is mapping back our conception of a relatively autonomous cultural practice onto another relatively autonomous cultural practice 3,000 years ago which was, however, in many respects very different from what we mean by ‘art’ in our contemporary culture (for example, it was collective, its authors were largely anonymous, it had no specifically dedicated sites of display, it had no explicit publicly articulated aesthetic discourse surrounding it, etc.). So the Egyptians, as it were, both did and did not have ‘art’. They did not have our conception of art but they did have something that shared enough with our conception of art to warrant a careful mapping of our category onto theirs, as long as we remain alert to the differences. Much the same, of course, can be said of the European medieval production of ‘art’, or even of the workshop practices of the early Renaissance.   The eighteenth century saw the emergent separation of the spheres in European life and thought, and one of the consequences of this was the increasing independence of art in Western culture from service to various non-art ends, be these religious, political or moral. The subsequent history of the development of modernism in the nineteenth century saw visual art being further prised apart from narrative. By the end of the century the idea of a fully independent art was accepted in the avant-garde. This is a conventional sense of the development of modernism. Subsequent critics of various stripes have questioned as well as celebrated the autonomy of art, but few would dispute that the practice of art in the West in the century or so from  c .1860 to  c .1960 operated relatively autonomously from external controlling agencies. (This is not the same as subscribing to the ideology of a ‘free art’.) In that, art is of a piece with other sectors within modern Western sociality. The relative autonomy of art has not been separate from the growth of democracy and individual liberty. It should go without saying that this is not to identify modern art with capitalism. It may be more accurate to say that its characteristic features evolved in a constant tension with and as a partial negation of capitalism. But by the same token it most certainly does not have  nothing  to do with that economic system and its dependent social relations.   By the time the crisis of modernism began to build, early in the second half of the twentieth century, within the orbit of the avant-garde, that is to say not just in Europe and North America, but also in Australia, Japan, parts of South America, parts of Africa, the pursuit of art as an independent practice was a given. What was at issue in these different places varied widely. In the metropolitan avant-garde heartlands the crisis and critique of modernism were generally experienced as a need to reconnect with a lived culture beyond art; in newly independent countries it was often felt as the need to construct a national art. But in all these situations there was the assumption of an artist as an independent figure, perhaps taking decisions about the relevance of art to society at large, but doing so as an independent contributor, not an artisan or craftsman taking commissions or instructions from an outside body which controlled the whole range of activity from choice of subject to means of representation.   The art of the expanded field, which sought to interact with and influence a wide range of non-art activities and modes of being stood, so to speak, on the shoulders of autonomy, assumed the independence that modernism had gained. The hinge here was conceptual art, in its broadest sense: the movement that went beyond the finite formal configuration intended ‘for eyesight alone’, and licensed not merely an expanded range of objects but an expanded range of activities to qualify as practices of art.   25    It is important, I think, to see that it is this conception of art that informs the globalization of art in the late twentieth century and since. I am not just talking about the globalization of art as a symptom of the globalization of the economy. Rather I mean the active, internal logic of the process whereby, on the one hand there is the expansion of the practice of contemporary art into regions which had previously largely stood outside the practice of the international avant-garde, such as China and India; but on the other hand there is also the ‘retrospective’ expansion of ‘art’ to cover traditional practices that most certainly were not conceived and produced under the rubric of an autonomous art.   This had already taken place within the Western tradition, as earlier religiously determined visual practices, such as those we think of as Renaissance art, were translated out of the region of religion per se and into the region of the aesthetic – considered as relatively autonomous. We have already seen how it happened to a diverse range of cultural activities and products that became designated ‘primitive art’. But with the shift from modernist essentialism to a postmodernist aesthetic of diversity a global pool of works and activities appeared within the expanded domain of art. The result has been that ‘art’, a category that developed in Europe, that subsequently underwent a conceptual narrowing (e.g. securing its independence from literature) and then, on the basis of the security conferred by that narrowing, underwent a secondary phase of conceptual expansion, now includes not only an unmade bed but a Renaissance altarpiece, not only a pickled shark but a Chinese DVD,  as well as  a tenth-century Byzantine ivory, a fifteenth-century Aztec mask, a seventeenth-century Islamic pen-and-ink drawing, a nineteenth-century Japanese print and a twentieth-century painting made in Australia representing an ancient Aboriginal myth from the dreamtime in modern acrylic paints on linen support, subsequently sold at Sotheby's for a million Australian dollars.   I know I am labouring this point, but I think it is both important and difficult in respect of a viable conception of ‘world art’. On the one hand I am trying to argue that today's ‘world art’ – including not just contemporary Chinese DVDs but also Aboriginal art with its roots in the Dreaming – is a modern phenomenon. But, on the other hand, I am also seeking to avoid affirming the ideology of one-way traffic that underwrote a conventional sense of the priority of the modern Western avant-garde. On the contrary, I want to affirm that the sense an African artist made of Western  mimesis , the sense a Japanese printmaker made of perspective, the sense an Indian poet made of concepts of rhythm and expression, the sense an Aboriginal artist today makes of modernist colour field painting … all these are in principle no different from the sense a European avant-gardist made of an African mask. I think the overall situation that is in play here is, to employ a classic formulation, one of combined and uneven development.   In the present compass, I cannot aspire to map these relations adequately. It may, however, be easier to say what is  not  going on in this complex process. First, what is not going on is the accretion in a liberal spirit of ever more practices around a historically continuous, stable, easily definable core concept of ‘art’. Second, what is also not going on is that a narrow Western definition of art as autonomous and ‘merely’ aesthetic has been supplanted by a more inclusive understanding of art derived from a wide range of cultural practices occurring in the rest of the world.   Both beliefs are widely subscribed to. Examples of the former are not hard to provide, if only because they arguably comprise something like the contemporary unexamined common sense of the liberal consciousness. This stance makes everybody, everybody in the West at least, feel good. It is completely illusory and ultimately self-serving.   An example of the second cropped up in the discussion following my talk in Lagos.   26    When Bruce Onobrakpeya says that modern Western art is a ‘carbon copy’ of African art, and that Africans have a deeper respect for and appreciation of art than Westerners, he is saying something important, and forceful, as well as complex and compressed. Perhaps the first thing to acknowledge is the framing in terms of appropriation and exploitation. It would be a deficient art history that did not acknowledge the power relations subtending late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European interest in the arts of Africa, that did not acknowledge the murky waters out of which ‘pure form and pure expression’ were distilled. Moreover, the circuit he elliptically describes – whereby ‘modern’ art builds on African models, undergoes transformations into ‘postmodernist’ multimedia installations and becomes globalized – is in itself unproblematic; what makes it challenging is the position from which it is being said, and the conclusions drawn. For my part, I feel that one of Dr Onobrakpeya's conclusions is valid, the other not. First, he is saying that a relationship to art that is an ‘organic’ part of a way of life (as in the case of Benin ceremonial) is richer than a relationship to a form of commodity production defined by the market. Faced by the commodification and spectacularization of so much contemporary art, its sheer complicity with elite consumption, its role as a kind of court jester to finance capital, it would be hard indeed to disagree. (Although I think that what is really at issue here is the form of life in question rather than just the relation of art to it: the hunger for wholeness has its own dark history.) On the whole, however, I found myself in agreement with both Dr Onobrakpeya and many others in the audience over their unease with the apparent domination of market forces in the art production of the West. But I believe Dr Onobrakpeya is mistaken in the conclusion he draws from the other part of his argument when he says that complex cultural configurations such as shrines and the practices that take place around them were appropriated from African examples by Western artists of the late twentieth century intent on enriching their own practice and then replayed back to the world as ‘postmodernist’ art.   I want to try to get this out in the open in a moment. But first I want to note that the same nexus of ‘expanded’ postmodernist conceptions of art and global cultural practice figures in a different way in Charles Gore's important redescription of art in Benin. The conjunction is obviously a resonant one. When composing his critique of the conventional histories of Benin art, focused exclusively on the products of the court and its associated guilds, Gore draws on both the expanded field of art – that is, performance art, installation art, etc. – and the suspension of value judgement that was an important lever in the early critique of formalist, aestheticist modernism to license an argument that performative activities around shrines, as well as the physical aspects of shrines all the way from mimetic concrete or wooden figures to ephemeral chalk ‘drawings’ and feathers, are as valid forms of ‘art’ as the classic bronze sculptures of the royal court (and,  a fortiori , as valid as the Western canon).   I want to say two things about the expanded field and African (and other global) art practices. First, early essays in the expanded field of art – I am thinking of such things as Happenings and Fluxus events (or even forerunners such as Dadaist cabarets, Futurist soirées and Constructivist mass spectacles) as well as fully fledged postmodernist installations and performances – did not build on African examples. (The earlier ones were most probably rooted in the Wagnerian  gesamtkunstwerk , the later ones precisely in the occluded historical avant-garde itself and its revolutionary setting.) Second, early twentieth-century modernist abstract and expressionist art most certainly did build on African examples. The difference is crucial. Picasso and others were not interested in ceremonies, masquerades, ritual performances and so on (except perhaps as a kind of background to their fantasies about the ‘primitive’). What interested them were the formal properties of objects they encountered in European museums. They embraced these formal properties, which they mis-read in terms of a modern European theory of intense emotional expression as giving rise to distortion (distortion that is, relative to the mimetic norm of European art), and translated them into their own art.   It is most important to get the balance right here, the balance of forces between Africa, the European academic tradition and the European avant-garde. Charles Gore says of the art of Benin that, when it appeared in Europe, it ‘so clearly was it an art produced by a major civilisation’, comparable to the art of the Italian Renaissance, that it ‘changed Western attitudes and resulted in a new appreciation of the arts of Africa’.   27    This has to be qualified. First, the Renaissance comparison is overstated. The craftsmanship involved and the technology of lost-wax bronze casting was indeed linked to the Renaissance. But it was not taken as evidence of a persisting major civilization. What it did was encourage racist nineteenth-century degenerationist arguments that Benin society had declined from a level of civilization which they attributed to significant European influence in the sixteenth century. Culturally orthodox museum men had a lot of difficulty squaring the undeniable evidence of the bronzes' technical sophistication with the absence of a civilization they could recognize as such in 1897. It is not the case that Africa was suddenly promoted to the premier league of world civilizations, more that the discovery of sophisticated art appeared to demonstrate the presence of a previous civilization that had declined.   On the other side of the European cultural divide, as between academy and avant-garde, the leading modernist Roger Fry, in his appreciation of ‘Negro Sculpture’ written later, in 1920, explicitly differentiated what he saw as the artistic achievement of African wood carvings from what he also saw as the absence of an African civilization.   28    The new appreciation of African art arose not out of the categories of art into which the Benin bronzes were uncomfortably fitted, i.e. the canonical categories of noble materials, sophisticated craftsmanship and a high degree of mimesis. On the contrary, the new appreciation arose out of the transformed categories of the avant-garde, which were constructed in opposition to canonical forms and values around beliefs about abstraction, purification, distortion and the direct expression of emotion. The Benin bronzes were able to figure in this constellation of values in two far from straightforward ways. In one, they could be ‘translated’ from a quasi-classical mimetic formal language associated with bronze-casting into the discourse of the ‘primitive’  as if  they were ‘distorted’ direct carvings. As Kirchner, Pechstein and Macke did.   29    Or on the other hand the Benin bronzes could be admitted to employ a high degree of technical sophistication in the service of mimesis, in which case they were of little interest to the avant-garde, in fact having more in common with the academic art the avant-garde was arraigned against. As Carl Einstein did.   30    The general re-evaluation of African art – or, more precisely, of African carvings  as  ‘art’ – derived from the avant-garde. It is part and parcel of a wider redefinition of the artefacts of several cultures as ‘primitive’ art, under the rubric of ‘expression’. The Benin bronzes get carried along with this more generalized ‘re-evaluation’ of African art and, more tenuously, of African civilization; they do not  cause  it.   That is, the concept of ‘art’ expanded under the impact of the early twentieth-century avant-garde's rejection of the classical canon; the proximity to this of the Benin bronzes caused a problem for the status quo. It was the bronzes' partial formal comparability to canonical (that is, ‘realistic’) Western art that caused the moral problem over the issue of African civilization. Other forms of African culture – music, dance, masks, wooden carved figures, let alone the gamut of utilitarian objects from baskets to boats, instruments to weapons – were not suddenly opened to being regarded as art by culturally orthodox Europeans (and of course one can say the same for European ‘folk art’ too). For that to happen, one had to have an aesthetic rooted in ‘significant’ or ‘expressive’ form, not one focused on craft skill and mimesis.   It is precisely the resulting formalist, autonomous conception of art that is the  sine qua non  for expansion into a wide variety of linked objects and practices: from bottle racks to bus tickets, to mixed media performances, etc. It is only when this constellation of activities, almost half a century later, eventually became fully legitimated as art, over the dead body, as it were, of formalist autonomous art, that anything and everything the world over – song, dance, performance, sitting in a bathful of offal, talking to a dead hare  and  designs from the Dreamtime, religious shrines in Benin, etc., etc., etc. – became candidates for being treated as ‘art’, with all the attendant pluses and minuses of that status: serious critical discussion, display in art galleries and museums, international travel  and  commercial exploitation on the (not entirely coincidentally, globalizing) market.   These kinds of matter obviously have a bearing on what sense we make of the notion of a ‘world history of art’, and it goes without saying that they are subjects of very widespread debate, many voices within which would disagree with what I have said here. It is argued, not infrequently, that an Indian organizing concept, or a Chinese organizing concept, could be used to tell a very different story of world art than the one told here.   31    I do not doubt that it could, nor indeed that in the future some such large-scale redescription might occur. But at the present time, as far as I can see, that which is being written about in books, taught in colleges and debated in conferences is ‘art’ understood as I have described it: a particular historical concept that has evolved in a particular way to a point where it has ‘invisibly’ assimilated its Others in a global continuum of difference; and that only that relatively autonomous, open conception of ‘art’ could have done so.     Conclusion   So I want to come back finally to the argument about the Benin bronzes in the BM and elsewhere, and to the various debates over their mode of display and the question of their repatriation to Nigeria. As to mode of display, I take it that this is quite a simple matter. We have moved beyond treating things from outside Europe as not-art. (By the same token the producers or owners of things from ‘outside Europe’ are quite keen to have them designated as ‘art’ in a global marketplace.) Equally I think we have moved beyond separating things from their context under a rubric of universal form.   Nonetheless, this does not, to my mind, necessarily imply that we ‘move beyond’ a concept of art in the sense that the aesthetic object must needs become a vehicle for acquaintance with the wider culture.   In my view it remains important to continue to treat the ‘thing’ as an object of attention in its own right. This is one of the consequences of independence. The spectator has the choice whether to move on to a deeper cultural understanding of the piece in relation to its originary productive context. This is not necessarily the same as responding to it as a work of art and going on to make something else. It is no less important to register that originating socio-cultural context does not confer  the  meaning of the work (any more than does the intention of the artist in a more psychological sense). If we know anything from postmodernism, it is that meanings are plural, constructed and mutable. There is nothing wrong with picking something up and running with it, or, in more polite contemporary language, ‘translating’ it. The fact that Picasso ill-understood the socio-religious function of African masks does not detract from the significance of  Demoiselles d'Avignon  in the history of art, be that European art or ‘world’ art. Neither, of course, does it preclude someone else from making a valid work of art out of a critical encounter with Picasso's historically specific encounter with Africa, wherever they live. These things are not mutually exclusive.   I think I have said what I want to say about restitution. All I would emphasize is that I do not think all works of art should go back to where they came from: all Viking art in Iceland, all Impressionist painting in France, any more than all Benin art in Benin. What I would hope for is that at some point in the future a beautiful, secure, air-conditioned museum comes to pass in Benin City, perhaps along the lines of the Luxor museum in Egypt, which could house a comprehensive display of Benin works, and that interested visitors from all over the world could travel to Benin City to see them, and perhaps experience other manifold and complex aspects of the culture which gave birth to them.   Even if that situation were to happen, I do not think  all  Benin works of art should go there. Though I do think it would be perfectly proper for works to circulate between Benin, Berlin, London or wherever on a mutually agreed basis according to programmes worked out independently by museum specialists in all those countries in accordance with an international law formulated for the purpose (that is, without national political coercion). But that situation does not exist at the moment. There is a real danger that if works were returned to Benin in the present political and economic situation, they would be lost: either through physical decay or through various forms of theft, looting, etc. There is a further chance that, even if they were not lost, they would become difficult of access within the palace – and to my mind this is only marginally less serious than the matter of physical loss. They would be lost as art, as ‘world art’, indeed.   This suggests to me a further important consideration. For I do not agree with the argument that showing objects in glass cases in museums is to debase them, to denude them of their ‘proper’ meanings. As it happens, the ‘glass case’ argument is something of a rhetorical red herring. Modern museums often try to move away from glass display cases, other than for purposes of safety and preservation. To my mind, to be involved in an imaginative transaction with a work of art, to contemplate it for itself, to reflect upon it, even to appreciate the technical skills of its fabrication if they are germane to the experience, is in no way secondary to a different sort of transaction wherein the object is a component within a religious ceremony; or, for that matter, a political injunction, or any other kind of contextualizing framework. It is ‘texts’ and not merely ‘contexts’ that have claims on our attention. I do not think it is any bad thing to escape the thrall of religion; quite the contrary, I think it is far better to engage in critically self-conscious reflection about the works of our fellow human beings conceived precisely as that, especially if this requires some imaginative work to understand the Other. I am not inclined to concede the tenets of secular humanism either to a theocratic imperative or to a brand of cultural relativism that in fact depends precisely on the space of secular humanism for its own functionality.   Learning can undoubtedly be done and done well in a context where something was made and used. Why else would I myself have wanted to go to Africa rather than just read about the Benin bronzes? But this does not mean that a large proportion of what I know was not got from books. Ideally, I think, the acquaintance with a culture, the achievement of a sympathetic relationship to the Other, involves a dialectic of learning and looking in a variety of situations, some more or less contingent (this armchair, that library), some more or less essential (in the present case, the streets and buildings and people of Benin, Lagos, etc.; in another case, the river Nile and the tombs and temples of the Ancients). Part of my concern with identity politics is that I am suspicious of the claim that there is something congenitally inauthentic about a Western person's looking at an African sculpture in a museum; and, conversely, that authenticity resides in encountering it, not as a sculpture, as a work of art deserving of attention in its own right, but as a component of ritual. I am interested in works of art as part of an open situation, part of an open-ended self-consciousness about relations between different Others. That kind of openness is not something I readily associate with religion (any more than I associate it with the operation of spectacle, bureaucracy or market forces). But it is something that I associate with art.     Acknowledgements   I would like to thank all those who helped me during my visit to Nigeria in 2008, especially Prof. Duro Oni and Mr Demola Olayiwola, as well as Dr Bruce Onobrakpeya and Dr Peju Layiwola.

The Bronzes represent a culture rich in knowledge, technology and democracy; now dislocated in Europe they have become ornaments of pleasure sitting in glass cases in the drawing rooms of English private collectors, or being viewed and interpreted by gallery and museum visitors as examples of primitive art from the Dark Continent … the authorities must let the Benin Bronzes go home.’ Kevin Dalton Johnson, extracts from wall panel accompanying an exhibition of prints by Tony Phillips, Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, 2007.     18 Kwame Anthony Appiah, ‘Whose Culture Is It Anyway?’, in  Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers  (London: Alan Lane/Penguin, 2006), 115–35.     19 For further discussion of this issue in the context of colonization in Oceania, see Nicholas Thomas,  Entangled Objects: Exchange, Material Culture, and Colonialism in the Pacific  (Cambridge, MA, and London: Harvard University Press, 1991).     20 Suman Gupta,  Social Constructionist Identity Politics and Literary Studies  (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), 215, 94.     21 In verbal presentations of this paper I have used audio-recordings of the statements here transcribed.

29,Why are Western museums giving back their artefacts? | The ...,https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/04/20/why-are-western-museums-giving-back-their-artefacts,"NIGERIA IS MOVING closer to securing the return of some of its most treasured cultural artefacts. The Benin bronzes, sculptures that once decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, now in south-eastern Nigeria, were looted by British forces in 1897, along with thousands of other precious items. They are now scattered across more than 160 museums and countless private collections, mostly in the West. In March a German official travelled to Nigeria to discuss the return of some of the bronzes held in Berlin. The University of Aberdeen, in Scotland, has promised to return one of the bronzes within weeks. And this month the Horniman Museum in London announced it will consider returning its pieces. Why are they giving back the artefacts, and how far will the process of restitution go?
Some of the Benin bronzes lie in London, behind thick vitrine glass in room 25 of the British Museum’s Africa Galleries. An inscription describes how the items came to be in the museum’s collection. It has changed over the years. It used to tell of imperial bravery against bush savages; now it tells a story of colonial violence and expansion. At the end of the 19th century British forces razed the city of Benin to the ground, demolishing the mud-walled compounds, as well as hundreds of houses and ceremonial buildings. On the former palace grounds, officers built a golf course. Then they seized thousands of royal and sacred objects to take home with them. The bronzes were initially exhibited to show the vast reach of the empire. Today institutions such as the British Museum find themselves at an impasse, struggling to come to terms with their colonial legacy, taking some steps to return artefacts but not wanting to lose their prized collections.
Restitution also faces legal obstacles. Many Western museums are prohibited from disposing of their collections. In France, for example, all public collections are considered inalienable, making it impossible to remove even the smallest piece, whether to sell it or, more altruistically, to return it. The British Museum Act, a law from 1963, prevents the museum in London from doing the same. The law does set out limited exceptions (such as if the object is a duplicate), but returning the loot of empire is not one of them.
Still, there is precedent for governments relaxing such restrictions. In 1998, 44 countries agreed to the “Washington Principles of Nazi-confiscated art”, a pact to identify and return works stolen during the Third Reich. When Britain’s High Court ruled in 2005 that British Museum trustees could not return four drawings by old masters stolen by Nazis from a private collection in Czechoslovakia in 1939, the government passed a law to deal with the obvious injustice. Since 2009 trustees of various museums (including the British Museum) have had specific authority to return property stolen during the Nazi era back to its Jewish owners or their heirs.
Similar legislation could ensure the return of colonial-era artefacts. France offers an example. As the first president born after the colonial period, Emmanuel Macron has been more willing than his predecessors to consider restitution. He commissioned a report in 2017 which recommended the complete transfer of property to their countries of origin rather than long-term loans (as some museums have proposed). In November 2020, a new law was passed to allow the return of 27 artefacts to former colonies. Hermann Parzinger, the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, a government body that oversees 27 German museums, has called for international guidelines akin to the Washington Principles to help museums identify and return colonial heritage.
But this is unlikely to happen soon, especially in Britain. “Colonial history is still a touchy subject in this country, and you would need someone to put forward a test case,” says Alice Procter, an art historian and author. According to Ms Procter, one reason that British lawmakers made an exception for Holocaust-era artefacts is the knowledge that Britain had no responsibility for the atrocities. But when it comes to the Benin bronzes, “the historical violence being compensated for is a British act, not a German one,” making restitution a more delicate issue. Germany faces similar questions. In 2018 its government returned to Namibia the skulls of Herero and Nama people, whom German soldiers sought to wipe out after their rebellion in what was then German South West Africa. Indigenous groups criticised the German government for dragging its feet over the return, and over offering an apology. And the Natural History Museum in Berlin has been dodging requests from the Tanzanian government for years, asking for the return of a 39ft-long (13m) dinosaur skeleton discovered in the early 1900s by German scientists.
Legal hurdles may frustrate restitution requests, but politicians and institutions have shown a clear desire to defuse the colonial timebombs sitting in their public collections. Some governments, such as those of Germany and France, are now backing the return of part of their holdings. Others, such as Britain’s, will probably continue to “retain and explain” controversial artefacts instead, even though the vast majority are not on public display. The British Museum, for example, has 900 Benin bronzes and displays fewer than 100 in its permanent collection.
Correction (April 23rd): A previous version of this article said that the majority of the artefacts from Benin held by the British Museum are not accessible to view. They are, but they are not on public display.

Hosted   by   the University of Coimbra, Centre for Social Studies, the event will take place on the Zoom platform and last for one hour and half. The book will be launched by  Delinda Collier  (School of the Art Institute of Chicago),  Maria Paula Meneses  (University of Coimbra- CES),  Elísio Macamo  (University of Basel) and contextualised in relation to the Portuguese empire in Africa.   See the event blurb and further details below: Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date, and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen. Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of brass plaques and carved ivory tusks depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless privare collections. The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums.  Dan Hicks  makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism. Speakers:  Delinda Collier  (School of the Art Institute of Chicago),  Maria Paula Meneses  ( University of Coimbra- CES),  Elísio Macamo  (University of Basel). Author:  Dan Hicks  (University of Oxford) Chair:  Ana Cristina Pereira  ( University of Coimbra- CES).

'A startling act of conscience. An important book which could overturn what people have felt about British history, empire, civilisation, Africa, and African art.

Meticulously researched and gripping history of the British ""punitive expedition"" of the territory of Benin (now Nigeria). Motivated by greed, nationalism, false rumors, and racism, British military demolished this area and killed possibly 70,000 people, subsequently stealing as much ""loot"" as they could carry. This loot now sits in anthropological museums around the world, with concentrations in Britain. The author is curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and uses the vitrine cases of objects in his own museum to meditate on what needs to be done, to begin to unravel the bloody colonialist history and the continuing violence represented in these stolen objects on display. Written from the heart - highly recommended.

This book is thought-provoking and the topic is relevant to these times. The book may not be to the taste of all political stripes, but the issues treated are pertinent to the current geopolitical state of things. The writing style can be a little abstruse at times and the tone is sometimes high-handed. Still, this is an important contribution to the examination of how artefacts of history are handled, housed and used as propaganda pieces, with some possible solutions for fairer treatment of formerly colonized peoples.

This book is destined to become the standard for understanding the relationship between colonial era museums in Europe and the places they are supposedly meant to educate the public about. It exposes unhealed wounds and argues passionately - and convincingly - that museums need to take a more proactive role in addressing them. Well written and beautifully produced.

The red mist of moral indignation Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 8, 2020
Verified Purchase
The author is Professor of Contemporary Archaeology at Oxford, Curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, which might lead us to expect a work of objective and even-handed scholarship. The book’s title, however, is a warning that what we are actually going to get here is a vitriolic political tract written in a red mist of moral indignation against the British Empire. The British are relentlessly portrayed as entirely villainous – unscrupulous, avaricious and, of course, “ultra-violent” – while the poor Africans are simply their blameless victims, and the whole book is a demand for the restoration of museum exhibits to the peoples from whom they were “stolen”. The author’s almost unreadably pretentious style certainly does nothing to enhance his claims. For example, we are asked to picture ourselves looking at a display case in the Pitt Rivers Museum: “Hold your phone up against the plate glass of the triple vitrine. The silence and stillness are not natural conditions for the displaced objects on display here. They are the effect of a stilling, as when detention interrupts transit, and of a fracturing, as when a shrapnel shell explodes at its target, and of a silencing, as when a gun is silenced”.
The centre-piece, the prize exhibit of the book is the capture of the city of Benin by British forces in February 1897, and the subsequent looting of the celebrated Benin bronzes and their dispersal to museums and private collections. The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.
The centre-piece, the prize exhibit of the book is the capture of the city of Benin by British forces in February 1897, and the subsequent looting of the celebrated Benin bronzes and their dispersal to museums and private collections. The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.

The writing is stylish and quotable.
The argument is polemical.
But neither of these should obscure the depth of learning, scholarship and moral seriousness that run through every page.
It's worth saying though that this is a book which will confront you with truly uncomfortable truths. After reading you will have opened your eyes to injustices which make your jaw drop. In truth I'm far from sure I wasn't happier not knowing.
If you care about museums or art, history, culture or justice this is the closest thing I know to an essential read but if you're anything at all like me, expect it to leave you disturbed, saddened and blazingly angry.

I was really excited to get this book but unfortunately I struggled to get on board with the style. The message is really clear and wholeheartedly agree just felt it came across almost shouting/angry at times. Would have like more on the background/stories of how the items were acquired too

This is a powerful and important story, undone by the writing style and the grammar. I've just counted a single sentence of 159 words and I've lost count of how often I've read the phrase ""razed to the ground"".

33,"LACMA, Fowler feel pressure to return looted Benin bronzes ...",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-05-03/benin-bronzes-lacma-fowler-museum-looted-art,"Commentary: Two L.A. museums hold art looted during an African massacre a century ago
At least six sculptures, potentially as many as 19, stolen during an 1897 massacre by British colonists in Africa have been sitting quietly in two Los Angeles art museum collections for the past half-century.
That status is likely to change. Pressure has been building for longer than a decade for the return of thousands of objects looted from the Royal Palace in Benin City, located in what is southern Nigeria. Repatriation of Benin art is as essential as restitution for art looted during the Holocaust, which this theft resembles.
Britain’s invading imperial forces were after natural resources, especially the rubber and palm oil necessary for industrial expansion, when they targeted the palace. Mass murder at the seat of the Edo peoples’ nonindustrial African kingdom, together with the city’s virtual erasure, confiscation of its sacred relics and their triumphal display in Europe’s museums, carried with it a symbolic assertion of the superiority of Queen Victoria’s white Christian realm.
Most attention has focused on demands for repatriation from major museums in London and Berlin, capitals of countries directly engaged in African colonization at the end of the 19th century. Germany’s Foreign Ministry is reported to have recently begun negotiations for the return to Nigeria of more than 250 Benin sculptures in state museums. (A formal agreement is expected by summer.) The British Museum has been more equivocal.
Sacred plaques, carved ivory tusks, royal body ornaments and other objects are in the collections of at least 161 global museums — two-thirds of them in Europe — in addition to an unknown number of private collections. But stolen Benin art has been scattered far and wide over the last 124 years.
The Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y., snared a record public price for a Benin sculpture in 2007 when it notoriously sold a deaccessioned bronze head at auction for $4.74 million. (The price was more than three times the high estimate.) The Sotheby’s catalog said it had been “owned by a member of the British Punitive Expedition, 1897-1932.”
At least 38 American museums house more than 120 examples. Some of the largest and most significant holdings are at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, the Field Museum in Chicago and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.
By comparison, the number found in Los Angeles museums is modest. The relatively small quantity, however, makes ownership claims no less potentially illicit.
The most imposing sculpture is a 17th-century metal plaque showing the figure of a royal courtier in high relief. It was acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1974 in anticipation of its 10th anniversary.
The plaque, 19 inches high and 7.25 inches wide, is decorated with an incised pattern of quatrefoils that appear as stylized river leaves. The stippled pattern is associated with Olokun, a spirit the Edo believe resides in a palace beneath the sea and rules over water deities. Olokun signifies wealth.
The courtier stands frontally, feet planted firmly yet miraculously on thin air. He holds what appears to be an ekpokin — a circular gift box in which tribute payments were made to the oba, or king, and the oba made presents to courtiers.
LACMA’s collection website identifies the plaque’s material as bronze, but it’s more likely to be a copper alloy such as brass. Copper is plentiful in Nigeria, as is zinc. Tin, necessary for bronze, is less common.
Benin artists excelled at brass casting, made with a lost-wax process. Their production of refined plaques proliferated in the 16th and 17th centuries. Stacked atop another on the structural wooden posts of the oba’s audience hall as well as in the palace’s elaborate layout of interior courtyards, they charted centuries of royal Edo lineage and cultural customs.
Misidentification of bronze was common when the plaques were first stolen and later sold in the art market since bronze is a leading tradition in European sculpture going back to ancient Greece. The mistake, easily corrected with a simple metallurgic test, was so common that the entire genre of art is now known as “Benin bronzes.”
Locally, UCLA’s Fowler Museum holds the largest number of them. Founded in 1963 as the Museum and Laboratories of Ethnic Arts and Technology by Chancellor Franklin Murphy (later chairman of Times Mirror Co., The Times’ former parent), the museum soon received an enormous gift of some 30,000 works from London’s Wellcome Trust, established by American-born British pharmaceutical entrepreneur Henry Wellcome (1853-1936). Murphy, a physician, was familiar with the drug tycoon’s haul.
Wellcome was a voracious collector of scientific and archaeological artifacts and amassed more than a million objects during his lifetime. He acquired several Benin works before he died.
Within 18 months of the attack, Benin art was turning up in London salesrooms — some being sold to pay off costs of the African colonial expedition. Sales increased as the generation of British officials directly linked to the 1897 massacre began to die in the 1920s and 1930s. As Modern European art with stylistic roots drawn from African culture including Cubism and Surrealism continued to grow in stature, stolen Benin art steadily grew as desirable commodities in the commercial market. After World War II, African independence movements kept the spotlight on.
Fowler Museum Director Marla C. Berns, a scholar of African art, and museum curator Erica P. Jones are leading a seven-person team tracing provenance, or the history of ownership, of works in the enormous Wellcome gift. So far, midway through a 3½ year research initiative funded by the Mellon Foundation, six objects lead straight to the Benin palace attack.
An ivory tusk that adorned an altar commissioned by a mid-19th century oba, carved with elaborate figures, was bought at a 1931 London auction. According to Berns, the Foster and Son’s auction catalog described the tusk as “property of a Gentleman who was a member of the Benin expedition.”
A second 1931 Fosters sale offered a small, 6.5-inch pendant in the style of a three-figure plaque. Made between 1550 and 1650, the ornament is meant to be worn at the waist. It was sold from a large collection formed by Dr. Robert Allman, the 42-year-old chief medical officer when Benin City was burned to the ground and in a fierce act of British iconoclasm, a complex urban network of ritual earthen berms was plowed under.
Allman was also one of about a dozen expedition members who photographed the wreckage. One grainy picture shows a group clad in pith helmets surrounded by piles of palace art. Warrior figures, leopards, bells, hundreds of tusks, plaques — estimates are that 10,000 objects were looted.
A small, enigmatic 18th century copper mask to be worn on a belt sold to Wellcome in 1933 at Sotheby’s. Its solemn face and woven cap are decorated with frogs, a watery symbol of fertility and transformation that also appears in the plaque pendant.
A sculptural tableau of nine figures in a procession came from the collection of George W. Neville. Less than four months after the brutal sacking, the Liverpool trader displayed what he had carried off in an exhibition at London’s Royal Colonial Institute, a block from Trafalgar Square.
Surprisingly, two sculptures made by the Yoruba living about 140 miles west of the city have also been traced to the palace looting. How they got there is unknown.
Another dozen Fowler works are still being studied. Tracing ownership histories is thorny and often slow, yet essential.
LACMA has no curator for its modest yet significant African collection. The provenance for its fine Benin plaque is incomplete.
According to the museum, it was bought in 1974 from the celebrated New York dealer and collector Eugene V. Thaw with funds provided by the late Anna Bing Arnold, an unfailingly generous LACMA trustee. Thaw acquired it from prominent London art dealer Kenneth John Hewitt in 1954 — but there the trail of past ownership goes cold.
In a strange twist, LACMA also received a Benin sculpture of a warrior as a gift from renowned Hollywood agent Phil Berg, an amateur archaeologist. He donated his large collection of European antiquities and Asian, Mesoamerican and African art to the museum in 1971. (Berg died in 1983.) A LACMA spokesperson, when asked about the sculpture’s provenance, said the warrior was never received by the museum.
Last week, the sculpture’s collection entry was removed from the LACMA website. The figure’s whereabouts are unknown.
LACMA’s plaque was last exhibited in 2006. The altar tusk, belt mask and plaque pendant are included in “Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives,” the Fowler’s permanent collection display.
In an interview, Berns, who retires from her post in June, said the Fowler and other American museums, spearheaded by the Smithsonian, have been discussing the creation of a working group to navigate the complicated process of repatriation of the stolen art. (In Europe, the Benin Dialogue Group is a similar consortium.) Objects in U.S. museums are one or two steps removed from a direct link to the theft, which adds layers of research and donor notification.
The Fowler has a board of trustees, for example, but it’s also under the purview of UCLA. The museum’s prominent collection is held by the UC Regents. Formal deaccession is a lengthy process.
In Nigeria, a Legacy Restoration Trust was established to coordinate returns to Benin City in Edo State. A plan for an Edo Museum of West African Art, designed by distinguished Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye and to be built adjacent to the Oba’s Palace, is underway.
Two events in recent years pushed Benin art repatriation, under sluggish consideration for years, into urgent overdrive.
First was a 2017 speech by French President Emmanuel Macron that for the first time recognized European restitution of cultural heritage to sub-Saharan Africa as a moral right. A subsequent government report laid out rationales, terms and procedures.
Second was a bombshell book, “The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution,” published last November. Eminent anthropologist Dan Hicks, curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford, demolished Britain’s long-standing claim for the legitimacy of its retention of Benin art.
The old story was that the attack on Benin City was a valid punitive response to the unprovoked murder of an innocent British exploratory regiment on the orders of the Oba. The real story, which Hicks fully documented, is that Britain had been looking for years for an excuse to attack.
The Oba was blocking British corporate efforts to grab rubber and palm oil to keep the wheels of industrial power turning back home. Flouting an order from the Oba to stay away, a British expedition met fatal resistance. That became the excuse for the near-obliteration of Benin City.
“The War on Terror” is Hicks’ pointed chapter heading detailing Britain’s barbarous mass murder. The title conjures the sham Bush-Cheney administration rationale for a bloody 2003 rampage in Iraq as being a valid punitive response to 9/11.
Robert Draper has written an authoritative account of the deceit and misjudgments that the George W. Bush administration used to lead America to a ruinous war.
In fact, the Iraq slaughter represented a similar corporate grab sought by neo-conservatives for more than a decade. Bush’s only major international partner in the travesty was the U.K. and Prime Minister Tony Blair.
What happened in Benin City, as well as in Europe’s museums and markets afterward, was not a byproduct of empire, Hicks astutely writes. It was instead empire’s aim. This terrible history is one chillingly foundational brick in the Victorian era consolidation of European white supremacy, which would lead to genocide and Holocaust at home.
Perhaps that explains why Germany is in front of Brexit-era Britain in understanding the urgency of the art’s repatriation to Africa. Today, looted Benin art kept in European and American museums stands as a colonialist assertion of white supremacy over Black people.
The Fowler is actively working to resolve its issue. LACMA is more passive. A museum spokesperson, sidestepping an interview request, issued a boilerplate statement saying LACMA is “closely following the recent discussions” and pledging appropriate action.
Thanks to Hicks’ damning book, any argument against Benin bronze repatriation is like arguing against the return of Nazi Holocaust loot — a moral profanity. The appropriate action is for museums to give the stolen art back.
Then, because exposure to world art outside its country of origin is a huge social benefit for all, a second step might be taken. With all humility, implore the Edo Museum of West African Art to make some long-term loans to Los Angeles from its inevitably incomparable collection of Benin bronzes. The decision is entirely theirs.

Germany made a first step. However, ‘we need to break down the institutional inertia’, the Nigerian Ambassador to the country argues.
Much has been written and said of late about the Benin Bronzes and Africa’s struggle for restitution of its stolen cultural properties in general. As one of the interlocutors who has helped to revitalise this longstanding issue that continues to trigger curiosity and capture public attention, I feel obliged to share my perspective on the long struggle for the restitution of these priceless cultural assets and take stock of the journey thus far. At the centre of this global debate are the Benin Bronzes, an open-and-shut case of theft, murder and racism that transpired in 1897 and, for that reason, the locus classicus of looted African art. The Benin Bronzes stand in contrast to other looted African art that may have been ‘lifted’ from an archaeological dig or burial site; the Benin Bronzes were forcibly stolen from the city after it was violently invaded by a British ‘punitive’ force, desecrating/burning the palace of the Oba of Benin and breaking all Just War doctrinal conventions since the days of Saints Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. In Benin, Victorian missionary and explorer David Livingstone’s 3 ‘C’s—Civilisation, Commerce and Christianity—did not get a look in. Instead, it was a case of the 3 ‘R’s: Racism, Robbery and Rapaciousness.
It is important to remind ourselves that the premise for the 1897 Benin massacre was laid 12 years earlier in Berlin during the 1885 Conference that established the ground rules for the Scramble for Africa. The Berlin Conference created the framework for European colonial powers to partition an entire continent and forcibly take physical control on the ground whilst avoiding conflict among themselves. It adopted the Hinterland theory that granted a would-be colonial power with a coastal possession or foothold the right to lay claim to unspecified territory in the adjoining hinterland. This provided a basis for Britain, with an established foothold on the Niger Delta Atlantic coast, to send a ‘punitive’ force to the inland kingdom of Benin on a murderous expedition in the quest to establish full control over the hugely lucrative oil palm trade. Soon enough, Maxim guns and explosives produced a bonanza of antique Benin Bronzes and ivory, thereafter carted away to Britain.
Whereas the Oba of Benin was captured and exiled to be replaced by a British Resident as the new symbol of colonial power, the Bronzes and other looted items created a sensation in Europe popularised by the Illustrated London News weekly magazine. This sordid episode of plunder was further whitewashed and even supported by a couple of books at the time that framed and glamorised an indiscriminate bloodbath as a part-anthropological, part-civilising expedition into ‘darkest’ Africa. Participants in the Benin carnage and state officials would go on to sell the proceeds of their crime to Museums and private collectors in Europe and North America, while others were offered as impressive gifts.
The very existence of the Benin Bronzes and other cultural properties in Western Museums are a validation of Krishna Menon’s definition of colonialism as a permanent aggression. And, for as long as these proceeds of aggression remain tucked away in anthropological and ethnological Museums that are meant to serve as some sort of moral morgue for the colonial atrocities, the aggression continues to this day. They debunk national mythologies of appealing to moral suasion and rule of law, good governance and international best practice. And even as they remain for the most hidden in often dark basements and store rooms, blackamons - showcasing the precolonial depiction of black Africans by European artists - remain on full display in public spaces. None more so than those in the Mohrenrondell Park on the grounds of the fabulous Sansoucci Palace of Potsdam.
The Benin kingdom began demanding for the return of the socalled Bronzes shortly after the 1897 massacre. After independence in 1960, the new Nigerian state began demanding the same. Director of the Federal Department of Antiquities Eyo Ekpo was unvarying in his request for restitution, including a 1972 Note Verbale sent to European Embassies through Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making reference to a 1971 Resolution of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) on the ethics of acquisitions. The matter was brought into full international public glare during preparations for the 1977 Festival of Black & African Arts & Culture (FESTAC 77) hosted by Nigeria to celebrate black art and culture, with representation from Africa, North & South America, the Caribbean and even Australia. The 16th century Queen-Mother Idia Benin ivory mask was chosen as the symbol of FESTAC; the only problem was that it was part of the Benin massacre loot languishing in the British Museum. All attempts by the Nigerian government to secure the mask in time for the festival (even as a loan) proved futile. Instead, Nigeria had to make do with a replica hastily carved by local sculptors. For Nigerians from my generation born in the ‘60s into an independent nation and who grew up in the ‘70s, FESTAC left an indelible mark on our psyche. It was a moment of collective pride and validation of our nationhood and rich cultural heritage for black people that had endured slavery, colonial subjugation and institutional racism. It was- to paraphrase Jurgen Habermas- our Verfassungspatriotismus moment. FESTAC was also the final nail in the coffin of Hegel’s notion of black Africa as being un-historic with no history worth noting prior to contact with enlightened outsiders, partly because it lacked sufficient written history. My generation was benefitting from the works of Africanist history scholars with a fresh perspective on historiography and methods of recording history to include oral tradition, art (cultural pieces) and anthropological analysis. Cultural pieces were therefore physical validations of our identity and heritage, and an authentication of African history and historiography beyond a simplistic account of the history of Europeans in Africa. Eyo Ekpo’s requests for return or even loan of Nigeria’s stolen cultural properties from Britain and Germany are well documented in Benedict Savoy’s German language book Afrikas Kampf Um Seine Kunst (Africa’s fight for her Art). Savoy includes interactions with the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which manages Berlin’s public museums (including the defunct Dahlem Ethnological Museum and the new Humboldt Forum); they kept denying Nigeria had ever made an official request for repatriation. Successive Nigerian Ministers of Information & Culture have consistently called for a return of looted cultural properties, notably Prince Adetokunbo Kayode, who attended a 2008 Benin works exhibition in the Dahlem Museum.
Relying on United Nations conventions and resolutions for countries that hold the looted art to do the right thing, some African government functionaries inadvertently fell into the deniability vortex created by the passage of time that led to the oft repeated fallacy that no one had asked for the return of stolen properties. I arrived in Berlin as Nigeria’s Ambassador to Germany in the summer of 2017. Much to my chagrin, the Dahlem Ethnological museum housing the second largest collection of Benin artefacts in the world had just closed its doors in preparation for moving some of the proceeds of 1897 to the new Humboldt Forum museum located at the city’s Palace, which was still being revamped. I made do with a visit to Bode Museum’s Unvergleichlich (‘Beyond Compare’) exhibition that paired works from Africa and Europe side by side. A 16th century Benin statue of the Goddess Irhevbu, acquired from a William Downing Webster in 1900, was displayed next to Donatello’s Puto. Although it was no surprise that all the Benin pieces on display were from 1897, the exhibition also featured Ife bronzes, significantly 12th-15th century terracotta that once “convinced” Berlin-born archaeologist Leo Frobenius with certainty, they were the work of lost Greeks of Atlantis - as Africans were incapable of producing such masterpieces devoid of European influence. Under my leadership, the Nigerian Embassy Berlin organized and hosted its first Annual Cultural Day on 20th July 2019. The event was attended by politicians, museum curators and diplomats among several others, during which I delivered a speech unequivocally restating the request for the return of stolen cultural properties. I explained the importance of such cultural properties to our relatively fledgling post-colonial national consciousness, in addition to being a country with a youthful population that stood little or no chance of visiting European museums. Although I appreciated the Bode exhibition, it was equally important to allow Nigerian culture to stand on its own and be appreciated - and not simply to be perceived as an aspect of another culture.
This is precisely why the suggestion of co-ownership concept for these artefacts that has been floated at the Berlin Dialogue group will simply not suffice. It has been a slow process, made easier by our confidence in the cause that Nigeria is championing and the power it has to break down institutional inertia. The Embassy followed up with a letter dated 16th August 2019 addressed to Chancellor Angela Merkel (with Culture Minister Monika Grutters in copy) signed by me requesting for the return of all Nigerian stolen cultural properties and clearing any doubts or confusion about which Nigerian entity to engage in discussing the issue of return. We followed up with a Note Verbal which did eventually receive a response, followed by a visit of a German delegation to Abuja and Benin that met with the Director-General of the National Commission of Museums & Monuments and the Governor of Edo State. The visit is quite encouraging and is in my opinion a considerable improvement on leaving discussions in the hands of the Benin Dialogue group which, although useful, is not sufficient to facilitate the consummation of Nigeria’s 50-year request for restitution. An open-ended dialogue involving six countries and consisting primarily of museum representatives could end up being just that; an open-ended dialogue. The Nigerian government’s restitution demand is also not limited to Benin Bronzes, but includes Ife Bronzes and Nok Terra Cotta among several others, some stolen after Nigeria’s independence. And it is important that African countries get back what was stolen in order to awaken the muscle memory of abiding by laws, respecting due process and a rules-based international order. As there exist ample UNGA, UNESCO, ICOM and AU resolutions and conventions to facilitate a smooth return of ‘lifted’ items, the global return to normalcy (after stopping Robert Kagan’s jungle from growing back) must demonstrate that not only do #blacklivesmatter but #blackcountriesalsomatter. We are counting on Germany’s sense of decency to facilitate the restitution of cultural properties, nay mankind’s, as there are signs others may follow suit or even be first out of the blocks.

35,Benin Bronzes: Two experts give an assessment,https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/culture/benin-bronzes-two-experts-give-an-assessment,"In 2022, the first Benin Bronzes are set to return to Nigeria. Two experts explain.
In the former Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Benin – now part of Nigeria – there were countless sculptures and metal reliefs dating from the 16th to 18th century, the so-called Benin Bronzes. Many of these objects were stolen from Benin City at the end of the 19th century and found their way into European museums. At present, the Nigerian Federal government is requesting they be returned. In Germany, there are some 1,000 items in museums in Hamburg, Stuttgart, Leipzig, and Cologne. And there is a plan to exhibit them in the newly-opened Humboldt-Forum.
Summit meeting on restitution
At the invitation of Minister of State for Culture Monika Grütters at the end of April 2021, the German Federal Foreign Office, the ministers of culture of the federal states, and the German museums who are members of the Benin Dialogue Group agreed at a virtual meeting on a joint schedule with the overall goal of returning the artworks to Benin City. The Benin Dialogue Group is a coalition of international museums in which Benin Bronzes are on show, set up to drive dialogue with the partners on the Nigerian end. Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Maas commented on the summit on the Benin Bronzes: “It marks a turning point in our colonial history that we have been able to agree a schedule for the restitution of the objects with the museums and their patrons.
We asked two experts for their respective assessment of the debate on the return of the Benin Bronzes:
“A new museum in Benin City”
“The focus now must be on intensifying discussions with Nigeria to enable the first items to be returned in 2022 – that is our shared goal. At the same time, the Benin Dialogue Group, which is made up of international museums and experts, remains a crucial communication platform, for example for interaction on the development of the basic framework in the various European countries and for mutual support. Together with our Nigerian partners, we wish to support the planned Edo Museum of West African Art EMOWAA in Benin City from various perspectives and in line with the capacities of the individual museums concerned. With this setup, the Nigerian decisionmakers have an ideal opportunity to address the most important museums with collections and nurture contacts with them.
It is key that the museum project in Benin City materializes. A major role is played here by the Digital Benin Project. There has long been the wish on the part of our Nigerian partners that knowledge on the distribution of these art treasures around the world be bundled – including the historical photographs and documents on the Benin Bronzes. The online platform is destined to enable this. It will likewise be an important medium for scholars and researchers, for museums the world over and for knowledge transfer, and it will in future be hosted by the EMOWAA.”
“I consider it a new beginning”
“The current debate on the restitution of the Benin Bronzes is long since overdue and is to be welcomed. Essentially, the issue is that of the late consequences of failed decolonization. As a rule, the relocation of cultural assets in times of asymmetrical power relationships tends to be resolved at the end of that asymmetrical power relationship. However, when in the 1960s many of the former colonies of European countries gained their independence, there was no mention of how cultural assets should be treated. In Germany, which had lost its colonies at an earlier date, things were essentially similar. More than 50 years ago the Nigerian government requested the restitution of cultural assets, but nothing happened. In other words, cultural assets in Europe are residues of a negotiation that never took place over that separation. To my mind, it is very, very important that we adults today address this topic now and ensure that actions are taken, and that we do not leave it to our children, the way the players in the 1970s left the problems to us to resolve. We now have the responsibility to find a good solution and I consider the current efforts as a new beginning.”",,2021-05-14,2022 first benin bronze set return nigeria two expert explain former royal

On April 30, 2021, Germany’s Culture Minister Monika Grütters announced that restitution of a “substantial” portion of Benin artworks that are held in German museums to Nigeria will begin next year. She characterized this restitution as the country’s facing up to its “historic and moral responsibility to shine a light” on Germany’s past. The Benin ivories and bronzes, which stand out for their exquisite beauty and craftsmanship, are among the most contested colonial-era objects in European museums and Germany’s decision not only puts pressure on other holders of Benin artifacts but might have implications for other objects whose repatriation is long overdue.
Historians like Andrew Zimmerman have shown that German museums drew on colonial networks to amass their enormous collections, sometimes trading or purchasing objects, other times pressuring or tricking owners, and not rarely stealing what they coveted. A parliamentary inquiry in 2013 revealed that roughly 60 percent of the 50,000 objects in the Berlin Ethnology Museum’s African collection and slightly less than 50 percent of its South Sea collection were sourced from the German colonies there. While it may be difficult to assess the ethical circumstances of acquisition for some of these, the Benin artifacts arrived in Germany indisputably as a result of theft. In 1897, British troops raided the court of Benin (in today’s Nigeria), resulting in the exile of the Oba of Benin and the looting of an estimated ten thousand precious artifacts. Sixteenth-century carved ivory objects and bronze sculptures made with the lost wax technique were hauled off to Britain, where they were exhibited at the British Museum, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and many others. Part of the loot was sold to eminent anthropology museums on the continent. Twenty-five German museums together acquired 1,100 of these superb artworks, which became collectively known as Benin Bronzes. Five hundred alone were held in the collection of the Ethnology Museum in Berlin, and half of these were slated to be shown in the controversial new Humboldt Forum in the center of the German capital. These plans are now on hold, and the Humboldt Forum’s general director, Hartmut Dorgerloh, suggested that in their stead, visitors will find either replicas or empty spaces. Germany’s restitution of Benin Bronzes is not the first, but it is the first time that a country announces the return of a substantial part of its collective holdings.
To Nigerians, Africans, and diasporic Africans, the sacking of Benin City and Europeans’ refusal to return the Benin Bronzes came to epitomize colonial plunder and western arrogance. Repatriation requests for the Benin objects have been made, British scholar Dan Hicks shows in The Brutish Museum, since 1936 and especially after Nigerian independence—but with few exceptions fell on deaf ears. European and North American museums fancied themselves as ‘universal museums’ safeguarding world heritage and deflected repatriation requests on the grounds that precious artifacts would not be adequately preserved in countries of origin. It forced the Nigerian state to pay steep prices for objects from the 1897 raid when they came on the African antiquities market. The popular Nigerian movie The Mask (dir. Eddie Ugbomah, 1979) featured a proto-Killmonger action hero who steals the mask of Queen Idia back from the British Museum. As centrally as the Benin Bronzes feature in African discussions of colonial wrongs, they are only a minute part of a larger problem. A UNESCO Report from 2011 states that 95 percent of sub-Saharan cultural heritage is held outside the continent, largely in European museums.
To Nigerians, Africans, and diasporic Africans, the sacking of Benin City and Europeans’ refusal to return the Benin Bronzes came to epitomize colonial plunder and western arrogance.
Over the past two decades or so, however, pressure for the restitution of colonial objects has been building. In Germany, this museum-specific issue has paralleled the larger debates about colonial history, colonial violence, and especially the genocide of Hereros, Namas, San, and other groups in what was then the settler colony of German Southwest Africa (today’s Namibia) in 1904-1908. Since 2015, the German government, after decades of foot-dragging, has officially recognized the genocide but has neither issued an official apology nor offered reparations, despite two lawsuits by Hereros and protracted negotiations. In 2011, the Charité Research Hospital was the first German institution to initiate the repatriation of Herero skulls to Namibia, but the handing-over ceremony was a diplomatic debacle. The restitution debate took up steam with French president Emmanuel Macron’s 2017 promise to return wrongfully acquired objects from French museums to the former colonies within five years, and the report he commissioned from art historian Bénédicte Savoy and her Senegalese colleague, the economist and author Felwine Sarr, which argued for and sought to map out a path towards comprehensive restitution, made waves in France and beyond.[1] Savoy, who had been a member of the Humboldt Forum’s academic advisory council, left that council under protest in 2017, sharply criticizing the institution for its stance on colonial collecting, the ethics of exhibiting colonial-era objects, and restitution. The deafness of the Humboldt Forum’s leadership concerning these matters angered not only Savoy. Eighty-two decolonial and antiracist organizations had joined forces in the No Humboldt 21! coalition, which disputed the Humboldt Forum’s claims to rightful ownership of colonial objects and demanded restitution and cooperation with experts from the Global South in determining a way forward. The past decade saw a great deal of public events and debates about colonial history, the Herero genocide, and the repatriation of human remains and patrimonial objects. Museums were not just the accused parties but contributed to these debates with exhibitions large and small that thematized the colonial past and their own role in shoring up a racist world order.[2] In response to the persistent thrum of public events, the German Museum Association revised its Guidelines for the Care of Collections from Colonial Contexts and, in the final version (February 2021), expanded the chapter on restitution and recommended that museums cooperate with source communities. Less than a month after the publication of the Guidelines, the head of the German foreign ministry’s culture department, Andreas Görgen, traveled to Benin City to enter into negotiations that resulted in Grütter’s announcement of restitution.
What will happen to the Benin Bronzes after their return? There is talk they will be displayed at the planned Edo Museum of West African Art, to be constructed in the ruins of the former palace site in Benin City by star architect David Adjaye, who also designed the iconic National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC. The Nigerian state will assume full ownership of and care for the objects. Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki announced that his government is preparing to launch an independent trust composed of “the Royal Family, Edo State Government, the Federal Government, and international stakeholders,” to receive the artworks. In turn, Germany will assist Nigerians, helping with training and archeological projects onsite.
The big question is whether this return is the beginning of more restitutions or closes the door on them.
Longtime observers of German-African relations welcome this turn of events, but also note how long overdue this gesture is. Professor Jürgen Zimmerer, for instance, a prominent colonial historian and public intellectual who frequently weighs in on postcolonial matters, was unimpressed by Grütters’ proclamation. He noted that Germany intends to return only “a substantial portion” but notably not the entirety of looted Benin artworks. Who decides what will or won’t be restituted? And how to prevent the kind of familiar international horse-trading that pressures Nigerians to assent to a partial return or receive nothing, he asked. If all Benin Bronzes are illegitimately acquired, why not return all of them? In addition, Zimmerer criticized that the civil society actors that have consistently demanded restitution are not included in the negotiations and the process of initiating what Savoy and Sarr envisioned as a new “ethics of relation” between Global North and South. A partial return does not amount to a decisive gesture comparable to Macron’s speech or Willy Brandt’s famous kneeling in front of the Warsaw Ghetto monument in 1970.
The big question is whether this return is the beginning of more restitutions—Egypt’s request for the Nefertiti bust in the Neues Museum and Tanzania’s request for the giant dinosaur skeleton in the Natural History Museum immediately come to mind, both of them stars in the Berlin museum landscape—or closes the door on them. Will it persuade other European holders of colonial loot to commence restitution and cooperation, or will they dig in their heels? And will this restitution finally cause the German government (and perhaps other colonial perpetrators and profiteers) to budge on the question of apology and reparations?

37,Germany moves closer to returning Benin Bronzes | Apollo ...,https://www.apollo-magazine.com/germany-benin-bronzes-restitution-humboldt/,"The German government is exploring the possibility of returning the Benin Bronzes held in the country’s museum collections.
Andreas Görgen, the head of the German Foreign Ministry’s culture department, visited Benin City last week to discuss the Bronzes with the governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki and other Nigerian officials, including representatives of the Legacy Restoration Trust – a new, independent body established in Benin City to work with international partners towards the restitution of the Bronzes; the trust will act as custodians of any objects restituted to Benin. On 18 March, Governor Obaseki’s office released a statement announcing the establishment of the Trust, also noting that Görgen has ‘pledged to collaborate with the state government to […] ensure the retrieval of objects’.
The German Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the discussions when approached by Apollo, but reports have suggested that, while any agreement is not yet finalised, further details could include a promise from Germany to participate in archaeological excavations in Benin City, as well as to support the construction of the new Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) in Benin and training of its employees. The Art Newspaper reports that Görgen expects the agreement to be finalised by this summer.
In another development, on Monday evening, the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung reported Hartmut Dorgerloh, general director of the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, as having said at a press conference that when the Humboldt opens later this year, the museum will not exhibit any of the artefacts from Benin in the city’s ethnological collection, and that a decision about the return of the Bronzes could be made by the autumn. Dorgerloh has since said that the quotes in the report were misleading, stating: ‘As far as we know today, the Benin bronzes were largely acquired illegally. I share the conviction that there must and will be restitutions. The decisions on this will be made by the Trustees of the SPK [Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz; Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation].’
The director of the SPK, Hermann Parzinger, announced publicly in January that he supports restitution to Benin. In a statement sent to Apollo, the SPK reiterates that it has ‘never ruled out restitution in its talks with Nigeria’, and that it hopes the talks held with the German Foreign Ministry in Nigeria ‘will help speed a long-term solution for the cultural objects and art works from the Benin Kingdom’. Since representatives from both the federal government and other state governments also sit on the Foundation Council of the SPK, any decision it makes about the fate of the Bronzes may have ramifications for museums beyond Berlin; Hamburg, Stuttgart and Leipzig all house important collections. Barbara Plankensteiner, director of the MARKK museum of ethnography in Hamburg, told Apollo: ‘As co-spokesperson for the Benin Dialogue Group, I work closely with the Legacy Restoration Trust and the German Foreign Office to support the continued development of the EMOWAA museum project as the future home of these outstanding works of art.’
Enotie Ogbebor, an artist from Benin, tells Apollo: ‘It’s another big step in our journey towards the restitution of objects which were looted at the cost of so many lives and the destruction of our civilisation in the form in which it has existed for thousands of years, and we hope that as events unfold in the coming weeks, months and years we’ll be able to bring about some sort of recompense for the very disruptive act that was carried out against our society and our people.’
The Benin Bronzes – a collection of plaques, busts and other sculptures cast in brass, bronze and copper – were looted by British soldiers from Benin City in south-western Nigeria in 1897, along with carved ivories and other artefacts; they are now to be found in museums and private collections all over the world. The largest collection is held by the British Museum, but with more than 500 artefacts from Benin the ethnographical collections of Berlin are the second-largest worldwide.
The royal family of Benin has been calling for the return of the objects since the 1930s; in recent years, the Benin Dialogue Group (BDG) – which includes Nigerian representatives as well as museum professionals from the UK, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Sweden – has agreed to provide a permanent display for the new museum in Benin City, but so far only on the basis of rotating loans. In a statement sent to Apollo, the BDG says that ‘conversations are developing at a different pace in the various countries for initiating permanent returns’. Should Germany commit to the full restitution of objects, it will increase pressure on other governments to follow suit.",,2021-03-24,german government explore possibility return benin bronze held

Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.
Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes – a collection of thousands of brass plaques and carved ivory tusks depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.
The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. Hear Professor Hicks, author of 'Brutish Museums', make a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.
The Brutish Museums: the Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution was published by Pluto Press in November 2020

39,Germany to start returning Benin Bronzes from 2022 | Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/germany-start-returning-benin-bronzes-2022-2021-04-30/,"Germany aims to start returning Benin Bronzes to Nigeria next year, its foreign and culture ministries said, part of a growing trend to return cultural artefacts seized during the colonial era to their places of origin.
Britain's soldiers seized thousands of metal castings and sculptures in 1897 during a raid on the Kingdom of Benin, then separate from British-ruled Nigeria.
The ""bronzes"" - actually copper alloy relief sculptures, many showing court figures - were auctioned off and then spread among institutions from New Zealand to Germany and the United States, with the biggest collection in London.
""In addition to maximum transparency, we primarily aim for substantial restitution,"" German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters said in a joint statement issued with the foreign ministry and German museums late on Thursday.
""We want to contribute to a common understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of the people who were robbed of their cultural treasures during the times of colonialism,"" Gruetters added.
The Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin has more than 500 historical artefacts from the Kingdom of Benin in its collections, mostly bronzes.
The University of Aberdeen in Scotland said last month it would return a Benin Bronze to Nigeria within weeks, one of the first public institutions to do so. read more
The British Museum, which holds hundreds of the sculptures, has alongside several other museums formed a Benin Dialogue Group to discuss displaying them in Benin City, some officially on loan.
Plans are underway in Nigeria's Edo state, of which Benin City is the capital, to build a centre to store and study the returned artefacts by the end of 2021, and a permanent museum by 2025.
The German ministries issued their statement in conjunction with German museums that are part of the Benin Dialogue Group.

41,Are the Benin Bronzes On Their Way to Repatriation ...,https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/benin-bronzes-repatriation,"African nations have long demanded the restitution of poached cultural artifacts, ranging from cultural treasures to artworks and even human remains, appropriated by European colonial powers during their often brutal reigns across the continent. In former colonial countries, the debate has recently reached a high point as cultural and political figures make the case for restitution.
Among the most famous looted African treasures are the Benin Bronzes, the thousands of artifacts that the British troops looted from present-day Nigeria in a punitive mission in 1897. In Germany, in March 2021, headway was made in this long campaign, as The Humboldt Forum in Berlin announced it will begin seeking the process of returning the hundreds of Benin Bronzes in its collection.
Meanwhile, the University of Aberdeen announced that it would return a Benin Late Period bust, making it one of the first public institutions to commit to a full Benin Bronzes repatriation.
What became known as Benin bronzes, are in fact thousands of artifacts made of bronze, brass and ivory, looted at the end of the 19th century from the palace in Benin City in present-day Nigeria during a British punitive expedition. Although their exact number is unknown, it is believed to exceed 3,000. These objects include figurines, tusks, sculptures of Benin’s rulers, and an ivory mask.
In 1897, a large delegation led by Britain’s Acting Consul-General in the region James Phillips set off for Benin City despite requests from Oba Ovonramwen, King of Benin, to postpone their visit due to a sacred annual period for the Kingdom. Fearing that the expedition would interrupt a series of rituals, some chiefs, acting against Oba Ovonramwen’s wishes, ordered the expedition to attack. Six British officials, including Phillips, and almost 200 African porters, were killed.
To avenge their deaths, Britain responded immediately, sending troops on Benin under orders to invade and conquer it. After burning and looting the palace and exiling Oba Ovonramwen, the British confiscated all of the royal treasures to break the power of the monarchy, walking away with thousands of priceless objects.
Some of the objects were given to individual officers that took part in the raid, while most of it was taken to auction in London to pay for the cost of the expedition. The looted objects eventually made their way into museum and private collections around the world.
The British Museum has the most Benin Bronzes of any institution worldwide, counting 900 objects. It has often been the subject of protests from activists, scholars, and artists who claim that the institution owns stolen property; however, the museum officially stated that ""no formal request has been received for the return of the Museum’s Benin collections in their entirety.""
The works were snapped by other museums as well, including those in Berlin, where a new ethnological museum had just opened in 1886. Berlin’s Ethnological Museum — now a part of the newly built Humboldt Forum, today houses the second largest collection of Benin Bronzes, counting over 500 objects. Berlin’s Humboldt Forum, a new consortium of museums that had its virtual opening in December, has been criticized for plans to exhibit these cultural artifacts in spite of their questionable provenance. In Germany, there are at least 25 institutions with Benin Bronzes in their collections.
The rest of the works are scattered on several continents. In his 2020 book The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution, scholar Dan Hicks compiled a list of 161 institutions that have acquired Benin Bronzes by various means. The list includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Musée du Quai Branly–Jacques Chirac in Paris, the Vatican Museums, the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, and the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
According to Hicks’s count, only 9 Nigerian institutions own objects from the group.
Nigeria has been petitioning for the return of the stolen Benin Bronzes ever since the country gained independence in 1960. So far, only one institution, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, has committed to repatriating a Benin Bronze work. The museum acquired a bronze sculpture of an Oba, or Benin king, at auction in 1957. In an ongoing review of the collection, the museum determined that the sculpture had been ""acquired in a way that we now consider to have been extremely immoral,"" explained Neil Curtis, head of museums and special collections, in a statement.
After the unanimous recommendation by their expert panel, the institution has begun making arrangements for the sculpture’s return, which could occur within weeks. In a statement, Nigeria’s culture minister Alhaji Lai Mohammed described it as ""a step in the right direction"", hoping that other institutions will follow suit.
After the 2018 report by academics Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy recommended that France begin repatriating plundered African art in its holdings, Emmanuel Macron announced his intention to return objects to Africa within five years. However, none of the works has left the country yet and Macron has about a year to make good on his promise.
It seems that France's willingness to restitute the artworks was a wake-up call for Germany, where events have picked up speed over the past few weeks. The Humboldt Forum in Berlin said it would start pursuing the process of repatriating its Benin Bronzes. This decision has been left to the board of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which manages the collection of the Ethnological Museum.
However, Yusuf Tuggar, Nigeria's ambassador to Germany, wonders whether the Foundation is the right choice, stating for DW that it ""embodies the basic idea of ethnological and anthropological museums that goes hand in hand with the same ideology that gave rise to colonialism: the cultural hegemony of the colonizer over that of the colonized.""
Meanwhile, Germany's Minister of State for Culture, Monika Grütters announced in a press release that twenty-five German institutions will publish their inventory lists in a central database ""to achieve the greatest possible transparency in the comprehensive reappraisal of the history of the origin"" of the holdings from a colonial context and ""for the dialogue we are striving for with the societies of origin."" This is a significant step, since the requests for restitution must first be submitted in writing and should include details of which objects the country of origin demands back and why. This was so far impossible since only a fraction of the artworks has ever been exhibited.
Hermann Parzinger, President of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, said there will be a dialogue with Nigeria about how exactly to proceed. As he explained for DW, there is a ""willingness to make this process work now so that the Benin bronzes are returned but can still be seen all over the world."" In March 2021, Andreas Görgen, Germany’s director of cultural affairs met with Godwin Obaseki, the governor of Edo in Benin City to discuss the matter of restitution. Grütters, who chairs the foundation, will meet with culture ministers, museum directors, and foreign ministry representatives this April to work out a national strategy for the restitution.
The museum is persistent with its plans to exhibit the Benin Bronzes when it reopens in the fall, yet explaining that ""history of the Kingdom of Benin, but also the injustice that happened in 1897, is really at the heart of the exhibition."" Curator Johnathan Fine hopes the show would raise awareness of the history of these works and advance the discussion on their repatriation. Should the bronzes have been restituted by then, the idea is to use plaster casts of the artifacts.
If the Benin Bronzes do get repatriated, they would likely end up in the Edo Museum of West African Art, a cultural hub designed by the celebrated Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye. The museum is expected to open in 2025 in Benin City, right where the 1897 attack occurred. The project forms part of an initiative being led by The Legacy Restoration Trust and the British Museum to showcase the history and archaeology of the former Kingdom of Benin.
As Adjaye explained, EMOWAA will establish a new museum paradigm for Africa, since ""what we are proposing is an undoing of the objectification that has happened in the West through full reconstruction.""
A new dedicated space, EMOWAA will contain the rich, regal and sacred objects of Benin’s past, in a way that allows visitors not just the possibility of “looking in” but “looking out” into the visual landscape of imagining the once historic borders of a restored ancient kingdom.
Construction of the museum is planned to happen after a five-year archaeology project takes place on the site and its immediate surroundings to investigate the former capital of the Kingdom of Benin. According to Adjaye, the building's arrangement is derived from the ruins of the historic city that the current Benin City stands above, and all finds from the archaeological excavations will become part of the museum collection and will remain in Nigeria.
Editors’ Tip: Loot: Britain and the Benin Bronzes
In 1897, Britain responded to the killing of a group of officials by razing an empire to the ground. The men had been travelling to the ancient Kingdom of Benin, in what is now Nigeria, when they were ambushed and killed by local soldiers. Just six weeks later, the British had exacted their revenge, set Benin aflame, exiled the king and annexed the territory. They also made off with some of Africa’s greatest works of art. This is the story of the ‘Benin Bronzes’, their creation, removal, and what should happen to them now. When first exhibited in London they caused a sensation and helped reshape European attitudes towards Africa, challenging the prevailing view of the continent as ‘backward’ and without culture. But seeing them in the British Museum today is, in the words of one Benin City artist, like ‘visiting relatives behind bars’. In a time of fevered debate about the legacies of empire, loot, museums and history, what does the future hold for the Bronzes themselves?

The Brutish Museums : The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution by Dan Hicks
Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin.
They do not mention that the objects are all stolen. Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.
The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museum, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.

44,Statement on the handling of the Benin Bronzes in German ...,https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/newsroom/news/benin-bronze/2456788,"Welcome
Statement on the handling of the Benin Bronzes in German museums and institutions
On Thursday, 29 April 2021, at the invitation of the Minister of State for Culture and the Media, Monika Grütters, a digital meeting took place on the further handling of the Benin Bronzes in German museums and institutions. The aim is to arrive at a coordinated position in Germany and to reach a common understanding with the Nigerian side. The participants in the talks were the directors of the German museums belonging to the Benin Dialogue Group, which hold the largest collections in Germany from the historical Kingdom of Benin (Nigeria), the responsible Cultural Affairs Ministers of the Länder, the City of Cologne, which runs the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Federal Foreign Office.
The participants are in agreement that addressing Germany’s colonial past is an important issue for the whole of society and a core task for cultural policy. Fundamental political agreements have been reached and major steps taken in Germany over the past few years. Furthermore, German museums and institutions have implemented numerous measures to address the history and origin of their holdings. These include returning human remains and cultural objects from colonial contexts to their countries and societies of origin.
The museums participating in the talks have been members of the Benin Dialogue Group, with other European museums and representatives of Nigeria, since 2010. Significant results have already been achieved in this forum. In particular, the Benin Dialogue Group decided in 2019 to support the construction of the planned Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) in Nigeria.
Concrete steps
The participants agree that what happens with the Benin Bronzes is a vital element of Germany’s handling of collections from colonial contexts, which is also the object of international attention.
The participants reaffirm their willingness in principle to make substantial returns of Benin Bronzes.
In addition, the participants agree to
- create extensive transparency with regard to the Benin Bronzes in their collections and exhibitions;
- hold further coordinated talks on returns and future cooperation with the Nigerian side at an early date; in this context, one aim will be to reach an understanding with the Nigerian partners on how Benin Bronzes can continue to be shown in Germany;
- determine concrete actions and a timetable for the upcoming talks.
Not only the museums that are members of the Benin Dialogue Group, but also numerous other German museums and institutions have Benin Bronzes or other objects from Benin in their collections. The participants invite these museums and institutions to join in the process outlined above.
Transparency
The participants agree to ensure the greatest possible transparency as regards the handling of the Benin Bronzes. The Contact Point for Collections from Colonial Contexts in Germany, funded jointly by the Federation and the Länder (the Contact Point), will therefore publish a list of all Benin Bronzes held in the museums on its website (www.cp3c.de) by 15 June 2021 – in addition to the information on museums’ own websites. In addition, the museums will provide comprehensive documentation of the provenance of these objects and make it publicly accessible on the Contact Point’s website by the end of 2021. Where Benin Bronzes are shown in exhibitions, comprehensive information will be provided on their acquisition context.
In the medium term, it is intended that, as part of the three-part strategy adopted by the Federation, Länder and municipal umbrella organisations, an independent portal for collections from colonial contexts will be created within the German Digital Library, making all Benin Bronzes, and in future other collections from colonial contexts, held in German institutions accessible online.
Furthermore, as part of the Digital Benin project based at the Museum am Rothenbaum – Kulturen und Künste der Welt (World Cultures and Arts, MARKK), Hamburg, and financed by the Ernst von Siemens Kunststiftung, the Benin collections scattered around the world will be collated from 2022 in a central online platform, which will at the same time serve as the basis for colleagues in Nigeria designing the exhibitions at EMOWAA.
Talks on returns and future cooperation
The participants agree that talks with the Nigerian side about return processes and future cooperation arrangements between museums should be intensified. To this end, the Legacy Restoration Trust (LRT), a civil-society initiative to develop EMOWAA in Benin City, was established recently; it is supported by the Nigerian Government, the Governor of Edo State and the Royal Family of Benin. In coordination with the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media and the participants in the Benin Dialogue Group, the Federal Foreign Office began talks with them to sound out the possibilities for a uniform approach to the construction of EMOWAA as well as negotiations on storage and exhibition of Benin Bronzes in Nigeria. The most recent feedback from the Nigerian side indicates that the process launched in Germany by the Federal Government, the museums and the bodies that fund them is welcomed and supported.
The continuing talks with the Nigerian side aim to find appropriate solutions at expert level through dialogue to take due account of the historical circumstances surrounding acquisition and of both sides’ interests and expectations in respect of individual objects. A step-by-step approach is conceivable here. Discussions with the Nigerian partners are to cover not only returns to and cooperation projects in Nigeria, but also whether and how Benin Bronzes, as part of humanity’s cultural heritage, can in future be shown in Germany as well.
The participants agree that further progress should be made not only in talks about the development of EMOWAA and returns, but also on the specialist inter-museum cooperation between German and Nigerian museums and institutions begun in the Benin Dialogue Group. This includes training for future curators and museum managers, as well as the development of cultural infrastructure.
The International Museum Cooperation Agency currently being established by the Federal Foreign Office, in collaboration with the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, is intended to provide durable support for this process.
Process / procedure
The participants agree to determine, by the summer of this year, concrete actions and a timetable for the issue of returning Benin Bronzes. At the same time, the Federal Foreign Office, in coordination with the relevant museums and bodies that fund them, will hold further talks with the LRT and participating Nigerian agencies. The participants will together endeavour speedily to attain results that can be implemented. The funding bodies and their museums will put in place the legal and organisational conditions for this.
On the German side, the Federal Government talks will be coordinated on the part of the museums and the bodies that fund them by the Director of MARKK Hamburg, Prof. Barbara Plankensteiner, and the President of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, Prof. Hermann Parzinger. There is agreement that these two should be included in the Federal Foreign Office’s upcoming talks in Nigeria and that talks about possible returns must be held in close mutual coordination. Coordination in Germany will be monitored by the Contact Point. The participants aim to make the first returns in the course of 2022. This chimes with the Nigerian side’s plans for the completion of construction of the first EMOWAA buildings.
Conclusion
The next meeting of the Benin Dialogue Group will take place on 27 May 2021, at which point the museums participating in this discussion will report on current developments in Germany. The Federal Foreign Office plans to have further talks with Nigerian partners on the ground in the next few weeks.
The participants reaffirm that the aim is for the forthcoming talks to produce concrete results soon. The participating museums and the bodies that fund them will take the next steps with the necessary urgency, sensitivity and determination to attain results. The Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media and the Federal Foreign Office, in coordination with the Länder, will closely monitor and support the ongoing process of talks.

45,British museum to return looted Benin bronze artifacts ...,https://qz.com/africa/1477656/british-museum-to-return-looted-benin-bronze-artifacts/,"More than a century after they were looted, the decades-old campaign for European museums to return African art—particularly Benin bronzes—is finally looking like a real possibility.
This week, a report in France recommended the return of looted artifacts, including French-held Benin bronzes, in the country’s museums to their origins. Similarly, the Benin Dialogue Group—comprising of representatives from European and Nigerian museums as well as the Benin monarchy and local government officials—has agreed a deal for some of Benin’s most iconic pieces to be returned on a temporary basis.
The collection is planned to be on display at a royal museum under construction and scheduled to open in 2021 in Benin City, the capital of Edo state.
A return of these artworks to Benin City—where they plundered from during a British expedition in 1897—is significant. Several of the artworks looted from the palace of the Oba of Benin were of immense cultural significance and formed part of the kingdom’s way of life. Indeed, some of the items stolen formed part of coronation processes and were seen as a way to document the Benin empire’s history. Returning them will also “lend importance to indigenous art because for the longest time there has been some local disregard for art,” says Victor Ehikhamenor, an internationally acclaimed Edo-born artist. Some of the disregard stems from how indigenous art was ”demonized by colonial construct” by early-day missionaries, Ehikhamenor says. Those beliefs have somewhat hamstrung a local industry that has kept the culture of bronzes alive. Indeed, Igun Street in Benin, known for bronze sculpting, is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
While the possible return of the artworks is celebrated, the terms of their return continue to be debated. Rather than permanent restitution, long-term loans have been mooted—to the displeasure of many. “The language that’s been used is patronizing. I don’t like the word ‘loan’,” says Ehikhamenor. “It really offends my sensibilities as a Nigerian or as someone from Edo. They [the artworks] belong to the kingdom and the Oba’s palace where they were taken.”
But Enotie Ogbebor, an Edo artist who’s been a party to some of the restitution talks suggests it’s a prudent stop-gap measure. “While the government and the Oba are discussing at the highest level for permanent restitution, we don’t want a lacuna which has already existed for over 100 years,” he says. “[Let’s see] if we can put a framework in place to loan them so they can be seen by our people while these discussions are going on.”
Returning the artworks hasn’t won unanimous support in Nigeria.
Given Nigeria’s general lack of a maintenance culture, the fear is that the artworks may not be properly cared for once returned. Indeed, Nigeria’s few existing public museums are largely underfunded and derelict. The museums are also starved of mass interest and local foot traffic—a problem that’s likely to endure as history hasn’t been a prioritized subject in Nigeria’s school curriculum. As such, there’s a disconnection between the present generation and objects of the past that are major attractions at local museums.
Kola Tubosun, a linguist and 2016 Quartz Africa Innovator honoree, suggests a workaround which would see museums return artifacts with strong spiritual and cultural significance to their custodians while “leasing” others for continued display. “The museums can keep some of the artworks and share revenue with places where the art comes from. It’s a win-win.” Keeping some artworks in foreign museums, Tubosun argues, serves an important global heritage function as “people who go to see them learn about where its from and the people who made it.”
But an added danger to leaving artworks abroad, some believe, lies in the risk of appropriation. That was laid bare last year when British artist Damien Hirst was accused of cultural appropriation during an exhibition in Venice when one of his artworks, a golden sculpted head, caused a stir given its striking resemblance to Ori Olokun, a 14th century bronzehead from Ife, an ancient Yoruba kingdom.
For Edo-born artists like Ehikhamenor and Ogbebor, the restitution of the bronzes is also personal. While the artworks will showcase local artists’ cultural influences, crucially, they will also serve as a reference for a budding generation of artists and bridge the gap in Benin’s art heritage. ”Imagine if in the last 100 years, all the works of Picasso, Monet and Michelangelo were removed from society for 100 years?” Ogbebor posits. “That is what the British invasion did to Benin by removing those things.”
Returning the art, Ehikhamenor argues, is the first step to fixing that lost connection to indigenous art heritage which has also forced local artists to look abroad for more validation, appreciation and income. ”When I make an artwork, if a white man does not endorse it, I can not grow in the art world,” Ehikhamenor says. “The hole that the African artist has to climb out of was dug a long time ago and the ladder to climb out of that hole is held by the Western world.”

 Display, restitution and world art history: the case of the ‘Benin Bronzes’. 
 Visual Culture in Britain , 13(1) pp. 115–137.

 Abstract 
 The article begins by discussing changing modes of display for non-Western visual cultures in Western museums, including Britain. Using the ‘Benin bronzes’ as a case study, the article argues for the existence of three distinct frameworks of display, linked to changing paradigms of art practice (broadly speaking, academic, modernist and postmodern/postcolonial). In the second part, the article moves on to discuss issues surrounding debates over the restitution of works held in Britain and elsewhere to their places of origin, again using the case of the Benin bronzes to focus broader questions. Finally, the discussion moves outwards to consider some of the implications for current debates about a ‘world art history’: arguing that this latter needs not only to guard against the prospect of a quasi-imperial expansion of current liberal notions of ‘art’, but, perforce, must also take account of contemporary practices, themselves critical of both academic and modernist conceptions of ‘art’.

47,Germany to return Benin Bronzes looted during colonial era ...,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/germany-return-benin-bronzes-looted-colonial-era-77415252,"Germany to return Benin Bronzes looted during colonial era
Germany is returning hundreds of artifacts known as Benin Bronzes that were mostly looted from western Africa by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums
BERLIN -- Germany is returning hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes that were mostly looted from West Africa by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums, authorities said Friday.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas welcomed a deal reached with museums and authorities in Nigeria to work on a restitution plan for a substantial number of artifacts, calling it a “turning point in dealing with our colonial history.”
Germany’s minister for culture, Monika Gruetters, said the Benin Bronzes were a key test for the way the country deals with its colonial past.
“We are confronting our historic and moral responsibility,” she said.
Gruetters said the goal is to contribute to “understanding and reconciliation” with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen in colonial times. The first returns are planned for next year, she said.
A historian welcomed the plans, but said they don't go far enough.
“Sadly, there is neither a precise time plan nor an unconditional commitment to restitute all looted artifacts,” said Juergen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg.
He also noted it's not yet clear how many objects will be returned, or whether there will be any recognition of the efforts by civil society groups that had called for the restitution.
A British colonial expedition looted vast numbers of treasures from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, including numerous bas-reliefs and sculptures.
While hundreds of artifacts ended up in the British Museum, hundreds were also sold to other collections such as the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, which has one of the world's largest collection of historical objects from the Kingdom of Benin, estimated to include about 530 items, including 440 bronzes.
The British Museum doesn't currently have plans to return parts of its collection.
“The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged,” the British Museum said in a statement, adding that the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects is explained in gallery panels and on its website.
“We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest or peaceful exchange,” it said.
But Zimmerer, who has done extensive historical research on the Benin Bronzes, said the decision by Germany would likely affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle such artifacts.
“The pressure will grow, because the British position of simply not addressing the issue of restitution is no longer sustainable,” he said.

48,"The Brutish Museums, The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence ...",https://www.booktopia.com.au/the-brutish-museums-dan-hicks/book/9780745341767.html,"Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.
Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.
The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museum, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.

50,The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes ... - Amazon.fr,https://www.amazon.fr/Brutish-Museums-Colonial-Violence-Restitution/dp/0745341764,"The centre-piece, the prize exhibit of the book is the capture of the city of Benin by British forces in February 1897, and the subsequent looting of the celebrated Benin bronzes and their dispersal to museums and private collections. The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.",,2021-05-19,centre piece prize exhibit book capture city benin british force february 1897 subsequent loot celebrate benin bronze dispersal museum private collection attack benin

51,National Museum of Ireland Makes Plans to Return Benin ...,https://www.artforum.com/news/national-museum-of-ireland-makes-plans-to-return-benin-bronzes-85454,"National Museum of Ireland Makes Plans to Return Benin Bronzes
The National Museum of Ireland (NMI), Dublin, is the latest European institution to announce plans to repatriate its share of the renowned Benin Bronzes, part of a trove of more than 90,000 objects looted from what is now Nigeria by British troops in 1897 and scattered across the Continent, The Times reports. The museum joins Scotland’s Aberdeen University, which in March was the first to commit to returning its lone object; the Church of England; and German institutions including Berlin’s Humboldt Forum in doing so.
NMI has said it is working on returning twenty-one of the objects to Nigeria; while no official path forward has yet been revealed, officials acknowledged that the museum will make “restitution in full” in regard to the artifacts. The announcement puts further pressure on London’s British Museum, home to more than one thousand of the stolen objects, and Paris’s Musée du Quai Branly–Jacques Chirac, which already has plans to repatriate twenty-six of its objects, to return their collections, as activists for years have pushed them to do.
As more institutions are expected to return their share of the plundered treasures as peer and activist pressure mounts, according to Artnews, academics are pushing back against the repeated concern that the bronzes will be no safer back on their home turf due to the claim that many Nigerian museums lack the proper climate control. A number of the returning bronzes are destined for the Edo Museum of African Art; slated to open in 2025 in Benin City, the museum, designed by David Adjaye, is expected to have climate control and storage systems synonymous with those of its Western counterparts.
“Of course, we do have our problems, in terms of the state of our museums in the country, but that will not remain as it is forever,” said Abba Isa Tijani, of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments. “We have our plans to build more museums. That’s why the EMOWAA museum is a bold step.”",,2021-04-13,national museum ireland make plan return benin bronze national museum ireland nmi dublin late european institution announce plan repatriate share renowned benin bronze part trove 90000 object loot nigeria british troop 1897 scatter across continent time report museum join scotland aberdeen university march first commit return lone object church england german institution include berlin humboldt forum so nmi say work return twenty one object nigeria official path forward yet reveal official acknowledge museum make restitution full regard artifact announcement put pressure london british museum home one thousand steal object paris musée quai branly–jacques chirac already plan repatriate twenty six object return collection activist year push do institution expect return share plunder treasure peer activist pressure mount accord artnews academic push back repeat concern bronze safer back home turf due claim many nigerian museum lack proper climate control number return bronze destine edo museum african art slat open 2025 benin city museum design david adjaye expect climate control storage system synonymous western counterpart of course problem term state museum country remain forever say abba isa tijani nigeria national commission museum monument we plan build museum thats emowaa museum bold step,nation museum ireland make plan return benin bronz nation museum ireland nmi dublin latest european institut announc plan repatri share renown benin bronz part trove 90000 object loot nigeria british troop 1897 scatter across contin time report museum join scotland aberdeen univers march first commit return lone object church england german institut includ berlin humboldt forum so nmi said work return twenti one object nigeria offici path forward yet reveal offici acknowledg museum make restitut full regard artifact announc put pressur london british museum home one thousand stolen object pariss musé quai branly–jacqu chirac alreadi plan repatri twenti six object return collect activist year push do institut expect return share plunder treasur peer activist pressur mount accord artnew academ push back repeat concern bronz safer back home turf due claim mani nigerian museum lack proper climat control number return bronz destin edo museum african art slate open 2025 benin citi museum design david adjay expect climat control storag system synonym western counterpart of cours problem term state museum countri remain forev said abba isa tijani nigeria nation commiss museum monument we plan build museum that emowaa museum bold step

Germany plans to hand back ancient pillaged artworks known as the Benin bronzes to Nigeria next year, Culture Minister Monika Gruetters said on Thursday.
Most European former colonial powers in recent years have begun a process of considering the return of looted artefacts to the former colonies, especially in Africa.
""We want to contribute to understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen during colonisation,"" Ms Gruetters said.
""We expect the first returns to take place in the year 2022.""

The 16th-18th century metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of Benin are among the most highly regarded works of African art.
They are scattered around European museums after being looted by the British at the end of the 19th century.
The Ethnological Museum in Berlin has 530 historical objects from the ancient kingdom, including 440 bronzes. It is considered to be the most important collection outside London's British Museum.
About 180 of the bronzes are due to be exhibited this year in Berlin's Humboldt Forum, a new museum complex that opened in December.
Nigeria's ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar, had called for the bronzes to be returned.
On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Berlin was ""working with those involved in Nigeria and in Germany"" on the future of the objects, which he called ""a question of justice"".
""An honest approach to colonial history also includes the question of restitution of cultural assets,"" Mr Maas said.
Last month the University of Aberdeen in Scotland agreed to return a Benin bronze sculpture to Nigeria, saying it was acquired by British soldiers in 1897 in ""reprehensible circumstances"".
That decision raised pressure on other establishments, including the British Museum, to follow suit.
The British Museum is reportedly considering lending its bronzes to Nigeria.
Nigeria plans to build a museum in Benin city to house looted artefacts after they are returned, in a €3.4 million ($4.1m) scheme in which the British museum will take part.
Late last year France approved the restitution of 26 items from the kingdom of Benin, which were pillaged in 1892.

Berlin (AP) -- Germany is returning hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes that were mostly looted from West Africa by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums, authorities said Friday.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas welcomed a deal reached with museums and authorities in Nigeria to work on a restitution plan for a substantial number of artifacts, calling it a “turning point in dealing with our colonial history.”
Germany’s minister for culture, Monika Gruetters, said the Benin Bronzes were a key test for the way the country deals with its colonial past.
“We are confronting our historic and moral responsibility,” she said.
Gruetters said the goal is to contribute to “understanding and reconciliation” with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen in colonial times. The first returns are planned for next year, she said.
A historian welcomed the plans, but said they don't go far enough.
“Sadly, there is neither a precise time plan nor an unconditional commitment to restitute all looted artifacts,” said Juergen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg.
He also noted it's not yet clear how many objects will be returned, or whether there will be any recognition of the efforts by civil society groups that had called for the restitution.
A British colonial expedition looted vast numbers of treasures from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, including numerous bas-reliefs and sculptures.
While hundreds of artifacts ended up in the British Museum, hundreds were also sold to other collections such as the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, which has one of the world's largest collection of historical objects from the Kingdom of Benin, estimated to include about 530 items, including 440 bronzes.
The British Museum doesn't currently have plans to return parts of its collection.
“The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged,” the British Museum said in a statement, adding that the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects is explained in gallery panels and on its website.
“We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest or peaceful exchange,” it said.
But Zimmerer, who has done extensive historical research on the Benin Bronzes, said the decision by Germany would likely affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle such artifacts.
“The pressure will grow, because the British position of simply not addressing the issue of restitution is no longer sustainable,” he said.

The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.",,2021-03-12,centre piece prize exhibit book capture city benin british force february 1897 subsequent loot celebrate benin bronze dispersal museum private collection attack benin

The article begins by discussing changing modes of display for non-Western visual cultures in Western museums, including Britain. Using the ‘Benin bronzes’ as a case study, the article argues for the existence of three distinct frameworks of display, linked to changing paradigms of art practice (broadly speaking, academic, modernist and postmodern/postcolonial). In the second part, the article moves on to discuss issues surrounding debates over the restitution of works held in Britain and elsewhere to their places of origin, again using the case of the Benin bronzes to focus broader questions. Finally, the discussion moves outwards to consider some of the implications for current debates about a ‘world art history’: arguing that this latter needs not only to guard against the prospect of a quasi-imperial expansion of current liberal notions of ‘art’, but, perforce, must also take account of contemporary practices, themselves critical of both academic and modernist conceptions of ‘art’.

The first time Abdulkerim Oshioke Kadiri visited the British Museum, he was astounded. Mr. Kadiri, the acting director general of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, had never seen so many Benin bronzes in one place – the famous relief sculptures plundered from present-day Nigeria in 1897 and scattered to museums across the West. “I saw how my people were being appreciated” by the world, he remembers.
But his pride was quickly stifled by another emotion: loss. Most Nigerians, he knew, would never have the resources to stand where he did and look at their own history.
Why We Wrote This
The debate about repatriating African art involves issues that go beyond museum doors: identity, ownership – and coming to terms with the past. What should justice for long-ago looting look like in today’s world?
Who should be the caretaker of Africa’s cultural heritage – the Africans who created it or the Europeans in whose museums it has long been displaced? For decades, art experts and politicians have debated the morality and practicality of returning art. But a report commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron, which recommended returning art taken during the colonial period, has injected a sense of urgency.
Today, some of the Benin bronzes may be on their way home – temporarily – through a program to return items on loan. But whether that is a road map or a cautionary tale depends on whom you ask.
A dozen teenagers in matching burgundy school uniforms crane their necks toward a floor-to-ceiling display inside the National Museum here in Benin City.
“Does anyone know what this is?” asks Abigail Zaks-Ali. The tour guide doesn’t turn around as she begins to explain the photograph behind her. She doesn’t have to. She knows this story by heart.
The photo shows three white men sitting on stools, decked out in the white linen uniform of the 19th-century colonial explorer in Africa. Two have cigarettes dangling cavalierly from their lips. The third, his pith helmet casting a shadow over his face, is beaming. In front of them, scattered like old toys, are dozens of metal relief sculptures. More statues are jumbled behind them in haphazard piles.
Why We Wrote This
The debate about repatriating African art involves issues that go beyond museum doors: identity, ownership – and coming to terms with the past. What should justice for long-ago looting look like in today’s world?
“Those are our artifacts you see,” Ms. Zaks-Ali says. “These men took them to London and then sold them for a very low price.” The students nod in recognition. They have grown up with this story: the story of the British soldiers who arrived here in 1897, promising to negotiate; the story of the white men who instead torched the kingdom of Benin and carried away thousands of its precious artworks to pay for their expedition.
“You see how these men are smiling?” Ms. Zaks-Ali asks, finally turning to face the photograph. “They’re proud of what they took from us.”
A continent away, in the British Museum in London, dozens of reliefs like those in the photo are suspended in rows from floor to ceiling. The room is dark, and spotlights illuminate the rust-colored plaques and intricately crafted figures protruding from them. A few people wander through the room. One young woman takes a selfie in front of the reliefs. Few stop to read the text on a panel beside them, which explains how the works were looted. It is titled “The Discovery of Benin Art by the West.”
When a report commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron recommended late last year that the French government begin returning African art taken during the colonial period, it injected a sense of urgency into an enduring debate engulfing much of the museum world: Who should be the caretaker of Africa’s cultural heritage – the Africans who created it, or the Europeans in whose museums it has long been displayed?
It’s a debate that has been happening in various forms since the era of African independence five decades ago. And perhaps nowhere has it played out more prominently than in the case of the famous Benin bronzes, plundered in 1897 and eventually scattered to museums and private collections across Europe. More than any other set of artworks, the bronzes made African art visible to Europeans, igniting widespread interest by scholars, artists, and the public. But in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, they have also become a kind of shorthand for colonialism’s violent reign – and its lingering influences.
“These bronzes are more than art,” says Ikhuehi Omonkhua, the chief exhibition officer of the National Museum in Benin City. “Keeping them abroad is like holding our ancestors hostage.”
But now, some of the bronzes may be on their way home – temporarily. Since 2010, museum curators from Europe and officials from Nigeria have been working quietly on plans to return the items, on loan, to the city from which they were taken more than a century ago.
The story of the bronzes may be – depending on whom you ask – either a road map or a cautionary tale on what the great former colonial powers should do with their appropriated treasures. It illustrates not only the complicated practical questions raised by repatriation, but deeply moral ones about how societies deal with the violence in their past.
When European explorers arrived at the coast of what is now southwest Nigeria in the 15th century, they found an eager trading partner in the wealthy African Kingdom of Benin. The kingdom (not to be confused with the modern-day country of Benin) was soon trading slaves and goods such as palm oil, rubber, and ivory for guns and other European commodities.
That give-and-take relationship held steady until the late 19th century, when London began pushing to incorporate the territory into the fledgling British Empire. At the time, the kingdom’s oba, a hereditary king, was Ovonramwen Nogbaisi, and his palace was the administrative and religious heart of the monarchy. The kingdom’s highly skilled artisans produced thousands of metal and ivory plaques and sculptures depicting people and events to adorn the palace and for use in ancestral altars. Though the metal pieces are usually referred to as bronzes, they were largely made from brass.
To the British, the oba was a perpetual irritation, obstinately refusing to recognize their flimsy control of the region. And so in December 1896, British Consul General James Robert Phillips led a small expedition to the oba’s palace. The purpose, he claimed, was to talk trade with the monarch. But in reality, he intended to overthrow him. “I have reason to hope that sufficient Ivory may be found in the King’s house to pay the expenses in removing the King from his Stool,” Phillips had written to the British Foreign Office the year before.
Historical accounts of what happened next – and why – differ, but one thing is clear: Soldiers from the Benin Kingdom attacked the British party, killing eight soldiers.
In retaliation, the British stormed the kingdom with thunderous force. In February 1897, their troops burned large swaths of Benin. They forced the oba into exile and shipped much of his wealth – nearly 3,000 brass and ivory figures that had been his personal possessions – to London.
There, some artifacts were given to the British Museum, while hundreds more went up for auction. Of those, some ended up in private hands, but most found their way into museums in Germany and other European countries, as well as the United States.
In Benin, the theft of the bronzes became a symbol of everything Nigerians lost to British colonialism, a story passed from generation to generation like a parable. “We grew up knowing that our people were massacred and our art was stolen,” says Kingsley Inneh, head of the bronze-casters guild in Benin City. “It was something that was lodged in our memories from a very young age.”
Meanwhile, Nigeria had its own museums to think about. In the aftermath of the country’s brutal civil war with the breakaway Republic of Biafra in the 1960s, Nigerian authorities poured money into the development of cultural institutions, hoping they could do something independence had not: unify the country.
“This museum and many others were built to show us that our history was shared,” says Mr. Omonkhua, of the museum in Benin City. But a lot of that history wasn’t there. While the museum in Benin did have a few bronzes, its collection was paltry in comparison to what was on display in Europe. The two largest collections are in the British Museum, which holds around 900 pieces from Benin, and the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, soon to be part of the Humboldt Forum, which possesses around 530 pieces.
And as Nigeria plunged into economic free fall in the late 1980s, its museums became a target for art thieves. The most infamous break-in came in 1994, when robbers stole artifacts worth about $200 million. For curators like Mr. Omonkhua, who had spent their careers evangelizing about the value of museums, the losses were devastating. Even worse, he says, is the way they became a symbol of Nigeria’s carelessness with its own history. If Nigerians couldn’t protect the contents of their museums, the argument went, why should European institutions entrust them with more objects?
The first time Abdulkerim Oshioke Kadiri visited the British Museum, in 2008, the acting director general of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments was astounded. Even though he had toured dozens of museums in Nigeria, he had never seen so many Benin bronzes in one place. “I saw how my people were being appreciated” by the world, he remembers. “I was amazed at how well [the bronzes] were cared for and displayed.”
But his pride was quickly stifled by another emotion: loss. “The naked fact is that these were stolen from us,” he says. “They shouldn’t be here. They didn’t arrive freely.” Most Nigerians, he knew, would never have the resources to stand where he did, in a museum in London, and look at their own history.
Western curators have long deployed a range of arguments to keep it that way: that countries of origin don’t have the museum infrastructure required to keep the artifacts safe, to adequately care for them, or to offer access to the public. That it is not always clear to whom the artifacts should be given – the people they were taken from or the nation-state that exists now? That the public interest served by eminent museums, and how they help people understand the world, outweighs the claims to restitution.
Chris Spring, who was curator of the Africa galleries at the British Museum until last year, says it would be positive to see loans of royal Benin works to Nigeria and possibly returns of certain pieces. “But in this day and age, in this multicultural society, a total repatriation of all those objects would almost be an act of vandalism in its own right,” he says. “It would be depriving so many millions of people of the knowledge of those extraordinary histories.”
For Nicholas Thomas, director and curator of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge, the question is a complicated one. In his office at the museum, which holds around 168 objects likely taken during the 1897 expedition, he acknowledges that arguments about conservation can sound like excuses to avoid restitution. “But it isn’t just an excuse,” he says. “There are plenty of cases where, despite the dedication of local museum staff, they don’t have the resources to manage material in the way that they would like.”
The Benin bronzes also illustrate how the ownership of artifacts can get complicated. The reliefs and sculptures were the personal property of the oba when they were stolen – so many might consider his descendant and current oba, Ewuare II, the rightful owner. But because the place they were taken from is now part of the state of Nigeria, the government there also claims them. Neither of the two museums in Europe with the largest collections of Benin bronzes has received an official request for restitution of the objects; one European curator suggested a disagreement over who they belong to could be part of the reason.
Even when returns are requested, the decision in some cases is not up to the museums at all: The British Museum Act of 1963 prohibits an institution from disposing of objects in its collection except in very limited circumstances, meaning any effort to repatriate objects would require government action. Similarly, French law considers the collections of national museums “inalienable,” prohibiting their removal. Other museums and countries have different legal frameworks and processes for dealing with their treasures.
To Jürgen Zimmerer, a history professor at the University of Hamburg who studies colonialism, all of these concerns are irrelevant, because the issue is not a practical one but a moral one. “The question is, do you keep objects which are stolen, or not?” If the answer is no, then there is nothing to do but return them, he says. “The idea that only Europe can keep objects safe is at the core of the colonial ideology, of the colonial gaze. We acquired these museums by looting, subjugating, even killing other people, and it requires a complete decolonization of our museum landscape or our knowledge landscape and people are refusing to do that.”
That means, he says, objects should return home even if the museums they are returning to aren’t as grand as the ones they are leaving behind. The National Museum in Benin City, for instance, has only three small galleries, and they are subject to the whims of a mercurial electrical grid. But the museum’s humble exhibits are carefully tended, and its staff brim excitedly with facts and figures as they shuttle tour groups through the round building.
“It’s a paradox, isn’t it?” says Mr. Omonkhua. “They don’t see us as intelligent enough to take care of our own history. They said we were monkeys, that we were not smart enough, and yet they valued the art produced by these monkeys and put it in their best museums.”
In 2007, Barbara Plankensteiner, then the curator of the Weltmuseum Wien, the museum of ethnology in Vienna, organized a monumental exhibition on the Kingdom of Benin that brought together hundreds of stunning artifacts. Three years later, she facilitated a dialogue with the goal of finding a way to make those treasures accessible to people in Nigeria, as well.
The effort, which became known as the Benin Dialogue Group, brought curators of European museums that hold collections of Benin works together with members of the Benin royal court, Nigerian museum curators, Nigerian government officials, and officials of Nigeria’s Edo State. From the outset, it was clear the group would not address the ownership of the bronzes. Instead, it would seek to bring them back to Nigeria through loans.
The progress was slow. By 2015, participating museums had still not signed a “memorandum of understanding” introduced two years earlier. Finally, last year, the group settled on a solution that managed to overcome the myriad hurdles: It announced plans to build a new museum in Benin City and fill it with some of the most iconic artifacts from the Benin Kingdom, from both European and Nigerian museums.
The Benin Royal Museum will be developed by Edo State and the royal court, with the support of the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments. European museums have pledged to contribute artifacts from their collections of Benin bronzes, on a rotating basis. The museum is scheduled to open in 2021.
The decision was celebrated in Europe, with headlines proclaiming the return of the looted treasures. But to some Nigerians, it felt a little like a slap in the face. “You can’t loan someone something that you stole,” says Emmanuel Inneh, a bronze caster in Benin City.
Officials are more circumspect. “We are anxious that our people should have access to their history in whatever way,” says Prince Gregory Akenzua, a member of the royal court and dialogue group. “We haven’t surrendered our demand for restitution. But we will participate in any effort to make these objects available to our people.”
Others see getting the art on loan as better than having nothing in their display cases at all. “You have to be realistic,” says Folarin Shyllon, a professor of law at the University of Ibadan and a member of the dialogue group. “Half a loaf,” he says, “is better than no loaf at all.”
European curators view the loans as the beginning, not the end. “I think we all understand in the group that it’s a minimum, and it’s a first step,” says Jonathan Fine, curator for the collections from West Africa at the Ethnological Museum in Berlin and a dialogue participant.
Just a few months after the group’s announcement, developments in France undermined the idea that loaning looted art back to the countries it was stolen from was an appropriate way to deal with the past. After declaring in 2017 that he wanted to see the “temporary or definitive restitution of African cultural heritage to Africa,” President Macron commissioned a report to plot a road map for doing so. In December the authors, Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and French historian Bénédicte Savoy, recommended that France immediately begin repatriating objects obtained without consent during colonial rule, if countries ask for them back. They dismissed the idea of long-term loans. Perhaps most shockingly, they proposed turning around the burden of proof: Instead of demanding countries prove the objects were stolen, France should have to prove they were not stolen if it wants to keep them, they said.
That pushes the debate into radical new territory. While it is widely acknowledged that the Benin bronzes were looted, there is disagreement or uncertainty over thousands of other objects in European museums. Professor Zimmerer, who is a member of a committee coming up with new guidelines for German museums, says the change is necessary. “A colonial context is a context of injustice,” he says. The imbalance of power, he notes, was so pervasive that even transactions that seemed fair may not have been. “Not every object is stolen, not every object is acquired illegally, but the assumption is that a majority of them are, and this should be the starting point of our deliberations.”
Curators reject the idea that most of the objects in their museums were acquired unfairly. “The debate has unfortunately generated a sense that these collections are really only about one thing and that is colonial appropriation,” says Mr. Thomas. “Whereas I think the collections have incredibly complex stories, and there is a lot of the material that reached museums in Europe through local agency, through indigenous agency.” He cites as examples objects that were diplomatic gifts or the “historical equivalents of today’s tourist souvenirs.” And he says that contrary to widespread perceptions, many museum curators do want to grapple with colonial history and work toward collaborative solutions.
No one expects the French report to lead to the emptying out of museums across Europe. Even those who advocate restitution don’t want to see all African art returned. Professor Zimmerer points out that many museums could return large numbers of artifacts without even affecting their galleries: The British Museum displays just over 100 of the 900 Benin objects it has. The Berlin Ethnological Museum displays about 50 percent of its Benin artifacts.
In the meantime, people in Benin City are hardly waiting around for their history to be returned. Down the road from the oba’s palace, wedged between mechanics’ garages, dental clinics, and used clothing stores, are the workshops of the city’s current generation of bronze casters. More than 100 men work along this narrow stretch of Igun Street, meticulously casting and recasting scenes from Benin’s history. It is a process that has changed little over the centuries.
“We are the journalists of Benin,” says Mr. Inneh, the head of the bronze-casters guild, a hereditary organization that has long been the only supplier of statues to the monarchy here. “Before writing, this was the way we recorded events.” Important people and events in the history of the kingdom are cast again and again, as a way of preserving history.
“All we are saying is that these are ours,” says Mr. Inneh. “They were taken by force and now we want them back.”",,2019-04-30,two way read story quick read deep read 13 min first time abdulkerim

 Description 
 
      Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.  Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.   The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museum, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.     
 
 About the Author 
 
      Dan Hicks is Professor of Contemporary Archaeology at the University of Oxford and Curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum. His award-winning research focuses on the restitution of African cultural heritage from Euro-American collections, focusing on the place of ideas of cultural whiteness in ongoing histories of colonial violence.     
 
 Praise For… 
 
      ""A startling act of conscience. An important book which could overturn what people have felt about British history, empire, civilisation, Africa and African art. It is with books like this that cultures are saved, by beginning truthfully to face the suppressed and brutal past."" — Ben Okri 'If you care about museums and the world, read this book' — New York Times 'Best Art Books' 2020  'Hicks's urgent, lucid, and brilliantly enraged book feels like a long-awaited treatise on justice' — Coco Fusco, New York Review of Books 'Dan, your words brought tears to my eyes. I salute you'  — MC Hammer ""In his passionate, personal, and, yes, political account, Dan Hicks transforms our understanding of the looting of Benin. This book shows why being against violence now more than ever means repatriating stolen royal and sacred objects and restoring stolen memories"" — Nicholas Mirzoeff

62,The National Museum of Ireland Has Decided to Return Benin ...,https://observer.com/2021/04/national-museum-ireland/,"Repatriating stolen art is a definitively noble cause, and as such, a great deal of attention has been trained for the last few years upon the Quai Branly museum in Paris and its semi-stalled plans to return its Benin bronzes to their country of origin. Essentially, the process has been mired in bureaucratic difficulties and deficiencies in funding, which is why it’s been so striking to see other countries essentially fast-track the process of returning Benin bronzes to their rightful owners. In March, Germany announced that it will indeed return its holdings of Benin bronzes to the museum being built in what was formerly a palace site in Benin city. Now, the National Museum of Ireland has announced similar intentions.
Recently, the National Museum of Ireland announced that it intends to return all 21 of the historical artifacts that were looted from Nigeria in the 1890s that the institution has in its possession. Although there is as yet no formal plan for when the National Museum of Ireland will return the bronzes, the institution is reportedly devoted to carrying out “a restitution process” in full.
Additionally, The Times reports, Aberdeen University and the Church of England have also committed to returning their Bronzes to the objects’ country of origin. What these restitution processes will look like probably will differ depending on the institution, but the most important thing is that it gets done in the first place. In Germany, for example, there’s likely to be an exhibition of the Benin bronzes at the Humboldt Forum before they’re officially returned to Nigeria.
“As far as we know today, the Benin bronzes were largely acquired illegally,” Hartmut Dorgerloh, the director of the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, told Artnet News in March. “What consequences these decisions will ultimately have for the planned presentation of Benin bronzes at the Humboldt Forum is currently being discussed and will decided in consultation with the partners in Nigeria. One thing is certain, the exhibition will address the injustices.”",,2021-04-12,repatriate steal art definitively noble cause such great deal attention train last year upon quai branly museum paris semi stall plan return benin bronze country origin essentially process mire bureaucratic difficulty deficiency funding it strike see country essentially fast track process return benin bronze rightful owner march germany announce indeed return holding benin bronze museum built formerly palace site benin city now national museum ireland announce similar intention recently national museum ireland announce intend return 21 historical artifact loot nigeria 1890s institution possession although yet formal plan national museum ireland return bronze institution reportedly devote carry a restitution process full additionally time report aberdeen university church england also commit return bronze object country origin restitution process look like probably differ depend institution important thing get do first place germany example there likely exhibition benin bronze humboldt forum theyre officially return nigeria a far know today benin bronze largely acquire illegally hartmut dorgerloh director humboldt forum berlin told artnet news march what consequence decision ultimately plan presentation benin bronze humboldt forum currently discuss decide consultation partner nigeria one thing certain exhibition address injustice,repatri stolen art definit nobl caus such great deal attent train last year upon quai branli museum pari semi stall plan return benin bronz countri origin essenti process mire bureaucrat difficulti defici fund it strike see countri essenti fast track process return benin bronz right owner march germani announc inde return hold benin bronz museum built formerli palac site benin citi now nation museum ireland announc similar intent recent nation museum ireland announc intend return 21 histor artifact loot nigeria 1890 institut possess although yet formal plan nation museum ireland return bronz institut reportedli devot carri a restitut process full addit time report aberdeen univers church england also commit return bronz object countri origin restitut process look like probabl differ depend institut import thing get done first place germani exampl there like exhibit benin bronz humboldt forum theyr offici return nigeria as far know today benin bronz larg acquir illeg hartmut dorgerloh director humboldt forum berlin told artnet news march what consequ decis ultim plan present benin bronz humboldt forum current discuss decid consult partner nigeria one thing certain exhibit address injustic
63,The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes ... - Amazon.es,https://www.amazon.es/Brutish-Museums-Colonial-Violence-Restitution/dp/0745341764,"The centre-piece, the prize exhibit of the book is the capture of the city of Benin by British forces in February 1897, and the subsequent looting of the celebrated Benin bronzes and their dispersal to museums and private collections. The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.",,2021-05-19,centre piece prize exhibit book capture city benin british force february 1897 subsequent loot celebrate benin bronze dispersal museum private collection attack benin

64,Parzinger's misconceptions and misrepresentations of the ...,https://blog.uni-koeln.de/gssc-humboldt/en/parzingers-misconceptions-and-misrepresentations-of-the-restitution-of-african-artefacts/,"This contribution is available in: Deutsch

“The restitution of those cultural objects which our museums and collections, directly or indirectly, possess thanks to the colonial system and are now being demanded, must also not be postponed with cheap arguments and tricks.”
Gert v. Paczensky and Herbert Ganslmayr, Nofretete will nach Hause. (1)
In an interview dated February 2018, Dr Herrmann Parzinger, repeating an idea of Neil MacGregor, former director of the British Museum and now a founding director of the Humboldt Forum, declares that we need new stories: There must be new stories. (Es muss neue Erzählungen geben.) (2) Like MacGregor, Parzinger is uncomfortable with the history of the looted African artefacts in Western museums and would like to tell a different history but knows that the history of Europeans’ violent attacks and robbery in Africa and Asia are too well established. He would like to tell stories with the African objects when they are moved to a new location. Note the choice of words: ‘stories’ and not ‘histories’. What never seems to occur to Western museum experts who want to tell the stories of others, especially Africans, is that Africans may want to tell their own histories with the objects now withheld from them. This appears inconceivable to many Westerners. Perhaps they think we have some irreparable congenital deficiencies that prevent us from telling our own histories.
The desire to tell stories rather than the histories of artefacts has become widespread with Western ethnologists, who invite specialists and even non-specialists to tell their own stories with the looted objects. (3) With such practices, true histories are submerged, and the ethnologists gladly proclaim that they have no monopoly of interpretation of the objects. Each visitor makes his own interpretation, even if he has not studied ethnology; your interpretation is as good as mine, even although I spent three years earning a degree in ethnology and 4 years obtaining a doctorate. With this attitude, some exhibitions, pretending ignorance of the histories of the looted objects, refuse even to give you the barest information about the objects exhibited e.g. Unvergleichlich – Kunst aus Africa im Bode Museum. This attitude matches perfectly the cry for more provenance research, as if nothing were already known about the objects displayed. (4)
In response to a question about Macron’s suggestion to return African artefacts in French museums, Parzinger says that it is an interesting suggestion but asks: “Only, the question is: which museum will return which object and for which reason and to which African museum? Who takes such a decision, the museum or the political authorities?” Parzinger states that such questions must be decided by an international conference. Raising such questions is part of the new credo of German authorities to plead ignorance about the African artefacts that have been lying in their museums for more than a hundred years.
Twice in this short interview, Parzinger challenges the general opinion that a large number of the artefacts in the ethnological museums are looted/stolen:
“One should not always act as if all objects were stolen.”
Speaking of the Benin bronzes, Parzinger again declares: “But to say they are all stolen objects, so send them back is too simple, especially since many pieces were acquired from the market before the British punitive expedition.” (5)
We do not know on what evidence the eminent archaeologist bases his view that many Benin bronzes were acquired on the open market before the British punitive expedition went to Benin City in 1897, deposed the king, killed many persons including Benin nobles and looted 3,500 artefacts that were later sold at auctions in London.
All the specialists we have read, and this is the general opinion among Benin scholars, state that before 1897 there were hardly any Benin artefacts in Europe and that it was after the notorious invasion that these objects were available on the European market. This was also the opinion of Felix von Luschan, who was instrumental in the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin, acquiring some 580 Benin artefacts. (6)
To our utter surprise, Parzinger again declares that the Nigerians have made no demand for the Benin bronzes. He then refers to the idea launched by the so-called Benin Dialogue Group to have a permanent exhibition in Benin City whilst ownership of the looted artefacts remains with European museums.
Many readers will immediately realize that there is no truth to the idea that the Nigerians have not asked for the restitution of the Benin objects. Just a few weeks ago, the Nigerian National Commission on Museums and Monuments demanded that Nigeria’s artefacts in Western museums be unconditionally returned. (7)
Wherever possible, we shall no longer entertain or discuss questions that aim at returning the discussions on looted African artefacts to the pre-Ouagadougou period and thereby seek to ignore or lessen the impact of the historic speech by President Emanuel Macron on the need to return African artefacts to Africa.
Parzinger refers to Macron’s speech but obviously with little conviction about its necessity or usefulness. He acknowledges that other European countries such as Belgium, Britain and Germany cannot ignore the suggestions of the French president, but apparently he is not recommending the Ouagadougou Declaration. He stays in the period before 28 November 2017.
Parzinger refers to the insulting idea launched by the so-called Benin Dialogue Group to have a permanent exhibition in Benin City of the looted artefacts whilst ownership remains with European museums. (8) For my part, I can only condemn without reservation a project that is an insult to the Benin people, the peoples of Nigeria and the African peoples. It could have been conceived only on the arrogant assumption that the Oba of Benin and the Benin people do not deserve to have back the Benin artefacts that were stolen by the British in 1897 in the notorious punitive expedition. The looters are here rewarded again, more than 120 years after the violent attack by foreign forces coming from afar. Those who lost their lives and property in that imperialist invasion are once again being treated with utter disrespect and contempt. We pray they and their ancestral gods do not hear about this last demeaning injury. Those Nigerians and Africans involved in this scheme must explain to the Oba of Benin and his people why they accept such a scheme. The National Commission on Museums and Monuments (NCMM) surely has a duty to explain to the Nigerian peoples its position here. Its recent demand for the unconditional return of Nigerian artefacts contradicts such a project. In my opinion, if that scheme is implemented, it will be sowing the seeds of easily imaginable future conflicts in Benin, between the Oba and his people, between Nigeria and the Oba, between the Western “owners” of the looted Benin artefacts and Nigeria. The exhibition of looted artefacts could crystallize the frustrations and disappointments of many groups in Benin City and in Nigeria generally.
I was very surprised that Parzinger kept referring to the Holocaust restitution scheme. Let’s hope he will not be surprised if parallels are drawn or contradictions pointed out between the German handling of compensation for the victims of the evil and atrocious Nazi regime and the lack of response to African demands for colonial reparations. Indeed, Parzinger uses the word “genocide”: “Der Maji-Maji-Krieg ist hier kaum bekannt, hat aber eine ähnliche Dimension wie der Genozid an den Herero und Nama.” – “The Maji Maji War is hardly known here, but it had a dimension similar to the genocide of the Herero and Nama.”
Is this a clear acceptance that Germany committed genocide against the Herero and Nama?
On three occasions Dr. Parzinger draws parallel to the Holocaust scheme: “Similarly, as in the case of Nazi-looted art, it must be reconstructed from the beginning. Similarly, as in Nazi-looted art, we want not only to react to restitution demands, but to proactively research and thus strengthen international cooperation. Provenance research is complicated and takes time. There is no reason for me to avoid this and we do not do that in the case of Nazi looted art.” (9)
Parzinger wants international rules for settling looted-artefacts questions and refers to the Holocaust restitution scheme. There is no need for any international conference or any new rules. The United Nations General Assembly/UNESCO passed resolutions that urge the return of these artefacts to their countries of origin. This should provide enough guidance.
A recent speech by Ronald S. Lauder, President of the World Jewish Congress, with the significant heading “Each looted art work throws a shadow over Germany.” (“Jedes geraubte Kunstwerk wirft einen Schatten auf Deutschland”) fully confirms this opinion. The speech ends with the appeal “Do the right thing! Do the right thing.” (“Tun Sie das Richtige! Tun Sie das Richtige.”) (10) Lauder points out that twenty years after the signing of the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, under which some 44 states were to identify the stolen artworks and restore them to the owners who had been unlawfully dispossessed of them by the racist Nazi regime, not much progress had been achieved and 73 years since the end of the last world war, one must still discuss this issue. (11) In view of this rather unfavourable criticism by Lauder, one wonders why Parzinger refers to this scheme. Is it the slow pace of implementation of the agreed principles that he favours?
On reflection, it is amazing that with all their resources, Western states and their museums have not been able to resolve the issue of restitution of looted African artefacts. This is, we believe, at least partly due to the absolute lack of respect for Africans, based on the racism Europeans manifested during the centuries of slavery and colonialism. In addition, there is the sheer greed and selfishness that have become the hallmarks of Western states and their museums. How come a museum such as the Ethnological Museum, Berlin, which holds some 508-580 looted Benin artefacts, is unable to return, say, 100 of those objects to the Oba of Benin? Benin artefacts are not part of German culture.
A clear demonstration of this greed that has become the creed of Western states and their museums was seen at the exhibition Benin Kings and Rituals Court Arts from Nigeria in Vienna in 2006. During an international symposium organized in connection with the exhibition, the representative of the Benin royal family stated that if each of the museums holding Benin artefacts returned one artefact each, the Royal Family would be satisfied. (12) What was the reaction of the Western museums? To my surprise, the then-Director of the Völkerkundemuseum, Vienna, Christian Feest, immediately responded, without hesitation, that it was impossible to envisage such a return and advanced the usual weak argument for holding other people’s artefacts. The remaining Western museum representatives kept quiet. The present writer responded and refuted the usual Western defences. The Western museums thus lost an excellent opportunity to solve the issue of looted Benin artefacts in Western museums. So much has contempt for Africans become part of the Western mind that many of those present did not immediately realize the full implications of Feest’s hurried answer. The Musée du Quai Branly, Paris, the Völkerkundemuseum, now the World Museum, Vienna, the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin and others could have started a process of resolving the questions that are still with us after 12 years.
Austria, Belgium, Britain, Germany, Switzerland and other European states holding looted African artefacts are surely better served by following the path indicated by the French president Macron than by following Parzinger’s ideas about elaborating new international rules that may throw the whole issue into disarray, raise more questions and not solve any of the present problems.
Looted without rules, African artefacts can be returned without rules.

ANNEX I – LIST OF GERMAN HOLDERS OF BENIN ARTEFACTS:
Almost every German museum has its own collection of Benin artefacts, but information on the numbers of artefacts is not easy to obtain. Below is a non-exhaustive list of holders that we could identify from catalogues, the Internet and the museums’ publications. In view of the public’s growing interest in these artefacts, perhaps the museums could publish a full list of the Benin artefacts in their possession. I understand that within the context of the so-called Benin Dialogue Group, lists of the Benin collections of members of the group have been exchanged, but true to the well-established attitude of the museums, they do not feel obliged to inform the public.
Berlin – Ethnologisches Museum/ Humboldt Forum – 580.
Cologne – Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum – 73.
Dresden – Staatliches Museum für Völkerkunde – 182.
Frankfurt am Main – 51.
Hamburg – Museum für Völkerkunde/Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe – 196.
Leipzig – Museum für Völkerkunde – 87.
Munich– Museum Fünf Kontinente – 25.
Stuttgart – Linden Museum-Staatliches Museum für Völkerkunde – 80.
According to Kathy Curnow, each of the following German cities have no more than 25 Benin artefacts: Braunschweig, Bremen, Dusseldorf, Freiburg, Göttingen, Hanover, Heidelberg, Hildesheim, Mannheim and Ulm.

ANNEX II- BENIN ARTEFACTS IN PRIVATE COLLECTIONS IN GERMANY:
In the discussions on the restitution of looted Benin artefacts, attention is generally focussed on the major public museums in Europe and the USA, which tend to have large collections of the precious treasures that are sorely missing in Benin City and Nigeria and indeed on the whole continent of Africa. The story that Benin artefacts are spread all over the world is, of course, a myth. The truth is that most of the Benin artefacts are in the Western world, especially the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States.
It is very doubtful whether, outside Nigeria, any African country has even one such Benin artefact. Do Africans not need to know about the famous Benin bronzes, especially since the image of Queen Mother Idia has become a pan-African symbol since FESTAC ’77, when the British Museum arrogantly refused even to “loan” the ivory hip mask to Nigeria?
Many private persons or institutions in the Western world have their collections but have so far not been touched by the Nigerians’ plea to return the looted artefacts. The only case of return by a private person is that of the Briton, Dr. Mark Walker, who returned to the Oba of Benin artefacts that he inherited from his grandfather. Man With Conscience Returned His Grandfather’s Looted Benin Bronzeshttps://www.modernghana.com/…/man-with-conscience-returned..
Other private persons and institutions do not seem to be moved at all by the plea to return some of the looted Benin artefacts.
Consideration must be given to how private persons and institutions could be persuaded to return Benin artefacts in their possession, for all Benin artefacts of good quality, whether in public or private possession, are part of the loot that the British stole in 1897 from the palace of Oba Ovonramwen when they burned his city down.
The number of private holders of Benin artefacts in Germany is not known, but one can get an idea of the quality of Benin and African arts in private hands in Germany by consulting books such as Dorina Hecht and Gunter Kawik (eds.) Afrika und die Kunst – Einblicke in Deutsche Privatsammlungen, 2010, Kawik Verlag, Bottrop, Germany.

(6) According to Christine Stelzig, at one meeting where art from Africa was discussed at the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin and the Benin bronzes were shown, it was mentioned that only Berlin was in possession of a relief plaque that, according to the information of the dealer in London, was already in London in 1879 and was the only piece of this form that had reached Europe before the destruction of Benin by the British. Felix von Luschan, Director of the Ethnologisches Museum, was one of the first persons to recognize that Benin bronzes came from Africa and not from some mythical place or people outside the continent: He confirmed that not a single Benin bronze was in Europe before the punitive expedition of 1897.
“He, von Luschan, did not know of asingle plaque or a single head or other bronze art work that was in a museum,or in the art market or in private possession that came from Benin to Europebefore 1897.”
“Er, von Luschan, kenne weder aus einem Museum, noch aus dem Kunsthandel, noch in Privat-Besitz auch nur eine einzige Platte oder einen einzigen Kopf oder sonst ein aus Erz gegossenes Kunstwerk, das vor 1897 aus Benin nach Europa gelangt wäre.”

he Church of England has promised to return two Benin Bronzes to Nigeria as the row over repatriation of African treasures continues to grow.
Lambeth Palace said it is “currently in discussions” about the return of the works which were given as gifts to then Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie almost 40 years ago.
They are likely to end up at the planned Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) which is being built in Benin City specifically to showcase the treasures of the African kingdom which is in present day Nigeria.
Benin was attacked by British troops in 1897 with around 5,000 works of art plundered and spread across the globe which are now being tracked by an online project gathering information about them.
A Lambeth Palace spokeswoman said: “We have recently been contacted by the Digital Benin project at the MARKK (Hamburg) who enquired about our collection of gifts at Lambeth Palace and if we had received any Benin kingdom objects as gifts over the years.
“In response, we have confirmed to the Digital Benin project that we have two bronze busts, given to us by the Benin kingdom in 1982. These were gifted to Archbishop Robert Runcie by His Excellency Chief (Prof.) Ambrose F. Alli and the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.
“We have offered for the two busts to be included in the Digital Benin project and eventually, returned to our friends in Edo, Nigeria where they may remain. We are currently in discussions with the EMOWAA, via the Legacy Restoration Trust, to arrange this.”
The move comes amid growing pressure on institutions to return looted works of arts with the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill one of the latest to take steps to potentially hand back exhibits.
The museum worked with Nigerian Londoners to develop its policy and says it is open to the “possible return” of objects “acquired at different times and under a range of circumstances, some of which would not be appropriate today, such as through force or other forms of duress”.
The Horniman statement went on to say “We understand that for some communities – whether in countries of origin or in the diaspora -- the retention of some specific objects, natural specimens or human remains is experienced as an ongoing hurt or injustice.”
Demands for the restitution of exhibits to their original countries is one of the biggest issues facing London’s major museums.
In 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron said he wanted African artefacts held in French museums to be returned and a report recommended everything taken “without consent” during the French colonial era should be returned permanently.
In 2019, the National Army Museum agreed to return a lock of hair cut from the head of an Ethiopian emperor in its collection.
The hair was taken from the body of Tewodros II who killed himself when the British invaded in 1868, rather than be taken prisoner. It was returned to the Ethiopian government to bury along with the rest of his body.",,2021-04-12,church england return benin bronze repatriation row rumble church england promise return two benin bronze nigeria row repatriation african treasure continue grow lambeth palace say currently discussion return work give gift archbishop canterbury robert runcie almost 40 year ago likely end plan edo museum west african art emowaa built benin city specifically showcase treasure african kingdom present day nigeria benin attack british troop 1897 around 5000 work art plunder spread across globe tracked online project gathering information them lambeth palace spokeswoman say we recently contact digital benin project markk hamburg enquire collection gift lambeth palace receive benin kingdom object gift year in response confirm digital benin project two bronze bust give benin kingdom 1982 gift archbishop robert runcie excellency chief prof ambrose f alli university nigeria nsukka we offer two bust include digital benin project eventually return friend edo nigeria may remain currently discussion emowaa via legacy restoration trust arrange this move come amid grow pressure institution return loot work art horniman museum forest hill one late take step potentially hand back exhibit museum work nigerian londoner develop policy say open possible return object acquire different time range circumstance would appropriate today force form duress horniman statement go say we understand community – whether country origin diaspora retention specific object natural specimen human remains experienced ongoing hurt injustice demand restitution exhibit original country one big issue face london major museum 2017 french president emmanuel macron say want african artefact held french museum return report recommend everything take without consent french colonial era return permanently 2019 national army museum agree return lock hair cut head ethiopian emperor collection hair take body tewodros kill british invade 1868 rather take prisoner return ethiopian government bury along rest body,church england return benin bronz repatri row rumbl church england promis return two benin bronz nigeria row repatri african treasur continu grow lambeth palac said current discuss return work given gift archbishop canterburi robert runci almost 40 year ago like end plan edo museum west african art emowaa built benin citi specif showcas treasur african kingdom present day nigeria benin attack british troop 1897 around 5000 work art plunder spread across globe track onlin project gather inform them lambeth palac spokeswoman said we recent contact digit benin project markk hamburg enquir collect gift lambeth palac receiv benin kingdom object gift year in respons confirm digit benin project two bronz bust given benin kingdom 1982 gift archbishop robert runci excel chief prof ambros f alli univers nigeria nsukka we offer two bust includ digit benin project eventu return friend edo nigeria may remain current discuss emowaa via legaci restor trust arrang thi move come amid grow pressur institut return loot work art horniman museum forest hill one latest take step potenti hand back exhibit museum work nigerian london develop polici say open possibl return object acquir differ time rang circumst would appropri today forc form duress horniman statement went say we understand commun – whether countri origin diaspora retent specif object natur specimen human remain experienc ongo hurt injustic demand restitut exhibit origin countri one biggest issu face london major museum 2017 french presid emmanuel macron said want african artefact held french museum return report recommend everyth taken without consent french coloni era return perman 2019 nation armi museum agre return lock hair cut head ethiopian emperor collect hair taken bodi tewodro kill british invad 1868 rather taken prison return ethiopian govern buri along rest bodi

‘A real game-changer’- Economist
Walk into any Western museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.
Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes – a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.
The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museums, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.",,2021-05-29,description new york time best art book 2020 essential – sunday time brilliantly enrage – new york review book a real game changer economist walk western museum today see curated spoil empire sit behind plate glass dignify tastefully lit accompany piece card offer name date place origin mention object steal artefact embody history rapacious extractive colonialism well benin bronze – collection thousand metal plaque sculpture depict history royal court obas benin city nigeria pillage british naval attack 1897 loot pass queen victoria british museum countless private collection story benin bronze sits heart heat debate cultural restitution repatriation decolonisation museum brutish museum dan hick make powerful case urgent return object part wider project address outstanding debt colonialism,descript new york time best art book 2020 essenti – sunday time brilliantli enrag – new york review book a real game changer economist walk western museum today see curat spoil empir sit behind plate glass dignifi tast lit accompani piec card offer name date place origin mention object stolen artefact embodi histori rapaci extract coloni better benin bronz – collect thousand metal plaqu sculptur depict histori royal court oba benin citi nigeria pillag british naval attack 1897 loot pass queen victoria british museum countless privat collect stori benin bronz sit heart heat debat cultur restitut repatri decolonis museum brutish museum dan hick make power case urgent return object part wider project address outstand debt coloni

What are they?
The 'Benin Bronzes' (made of brass and bronze) are a group of sculptures which include elaborately decorated cast plaques, commemorative heads, animal and human figures, items of royal regalia, and personal ornaments. They were created from at least the 16th century onwards in the West African Kingdom of Benin, by specialist guilds working for the royal court of the Oba (king) in Benin City. The Kingdom also supported guilds working in other materials such as ivory, leather, coral and wood, and the term 'Benin Bronzes' is sometimes used to refer to historic objects produced using these other materials.
Many pieces were commissioned specifically for the ancestral altars of past Obas and Queen Mothers. They were also used in other rituals to honour the ancestors and to validate the accession of a new Oba. A key element of the Benin Bronzes are the plaques which once decorated the Benin Royal Palace and which provide an important historical record of the Kingdom of Benin. This includes dynastic history, as well as social history, and insights into its relationships with neighbouring societies. The Benin Bronzes are preceded by earlier West African cast brass traditions, dating back into the medieval period.
One element of the history of the Kingdom of Benin represented within the Bronzes is the kingdom's early contacts with Europeans. Trade and diplomatic contacts between Benin and Portugal developed on the West African coast from the 15th century. These early connections included Portuguese and Benin emissaries voyaging between the capitals and courts of Benin and Portugal as these two powers negotiated their new relationship.
There are around 900 objects from the historic Kingdom of Benin in the British Museum's collection. Over 100 can be seen in a permanent changing display within the Museum's galleries. Objects from Benin are also lent regularly around the world. The British Museum's collections additionally include a range of archival documentation and photographic collections relating to the Benin Bronzes and their collection history.
Where are they from?
The Benin Bronzes come from Benin City, the historic capital of the Kingdom of Benin, a major city state in West Africa from the medieval period. Benin became part of the British Empire from 1897 to 1960 and is now within the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
Today the modern city of Benin (in Edo State) is the home of the current ruler of the Kingdom of Benin, His Royal Majesty Oba Ewuare II. Many of the rituals and ceremonies associated with the historic Kingdom of Benin continue to be performed today.
How did the objects come to the British Museum?
By the end of the 19th century, the Nigerian coast and its trade were largely dominated by the British. It is in the context of this emerging colonial power that the Benin Bronzes came to the British Museum.
During the second half of the 19th century, the balance of power between West African kingdoms like Benin and the European nations they traded with shifted massively towards European control. In the late 19th century, industrialised European nations accompanied by new military technologies began to exert greater power across the African continent. This political and commercial movement developed into the territorial land-grab known as the 'Scramble for Africa'.
A further fundamental context that needs to be recognised for fully understanding this period of West African history is the transatlantic slave trade. This vast traffic in humans supplied labour to the colonies and plantations in the Americas, including those of Britain. While by the late 19th century this trade had been largely abolished, its increasing scale and barbarity in the preceding centuries had led to a massive impact on West African societies.
The desire to further extend British power and influence in the region ultimately led to a clash with the Kingdom of Benin. The gradual expansion by the British into territory neighbouring the kingdom and an increasing reluctance to accept Benin's trading conditions created an atmosphere of distrust and animosity. In January 1897 an allegedly peaceful but clearly provocative British trade mission was attacked on its way to Benin City, leading to the deaths of 230 of the mission's African carriers and seven British delegates. This incident triggered the launch of a large-scale retaliatory military expedition by the British against the Kingdom of Benin. Benin City was overrun and occupied by British forces in February 1897.
Benin suffered a bloody and devastating occupation. No exact figure can be given for the number of Benin's population who were killed in the conquest of the city. However, it is clear that there were many casualties during the sustained fighting. The occupation of Benin City saw widespread destruction and pillage by British forces. Along with other monuments and palaces, the Royal Palace was burned and destroyed. Its shrines and associated compounds were looted by British forces, and thousands of objects of ceremonial and ritual value were taken to the UK as official 'spoils of war' or distributed among members of the expedition according to their rank. This included a range of objects removed from shrines, among which were ceremonial brass heads of former Oba’s and their associated ivory tusks. This also included more than 900 brass plaques, dating largely to the 16–17th century, found in a storage room within the palace. Having previously decorated the palace walls, these plaques were key historic records for the Benin Court and kingdom, enabling illustration of historic practices and traditions. Following the occupation, the Oba was later captured and sent into exile, while a number of Benin chiefs were executed. Justified as legitimate military action against a 'barbarous' kingdom, this brutal, violent colonial episode effectively marked the end of the independent Kingdom of Benin.
In the autumn of 1897, the British Museum displayed 304 Benin plaques on loan from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and subsequently petitioned successfully to receive 203 of these as a donation. The majority of the remaining plaques were sold to UK and German museums and to private dealers, while a few were retained by the Foreign Office. Other early collections were purchased or donated by members of the Benin expedition.
The collection only grew to its current size following the acquisition of major private collections, such as that of Harry Beasley in 1944, William Oldman in 1949 and Sir Henry Wellcome in 1954. In 1950 and 1951 the Museum sold, exchanged or donated some of the Benin plaques to the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria (25 in number) and the government of the Gold Coast (1). These were subsequently placed within newly established West African museums. At the time these objects were seen as 'duplicates' of other objects retained in the collection, something which later research has shown to be incorrect. A further number of such plaques (12) were sold to or exchanged with private dealers and collectors between 1950 and 1972.
What has been requested?
While no formal written request has been received for the return of the Museum's Benin collections in their entirety, the Benin Royal Court has made various public statements asking for Benin collections to be returned.
These requests have been framed within the context of longstanding dialogues with the Museum, including during the visit of the Director of the British Museum to the Benin Royal Court in August 2018.
Status of discussions
The Museum has positive relationships with the royal court in Benin City and with the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).
The Museum's Director, Hartwig Fischer, visited Nigeria in August 2018. He met with senior Museum colleagues in Lagos and Benin City and had an audience with His Royal Majesty Oba Ewuare II which included discussion of new opportunities for sharing and displaying objects from the Kingdom of Benin. During that visit His Royal Majesty Oba Ewuare II repeated his request for Benin collections to be returned. He also acknowledged, however, that the objects serve as 'cultural ambassadors' for Benin culture when displayed internationally.
The British Museum is also a member of the Benin Dialogue Group, a working group bringing together museum representatives from Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom with key representatives from Nigeria, including the Benin Royal Court and NCMM.
A central objective for the Benin Dialogue Group is to work together to establish a new museum in Benin City to facilitate a new permanent display of Benin works of art, including significant collections of works currently in UK and European museums.
The British Museum's position
The British Museum has excellent long-term working relationships with Nigerian colleagues and institutions, particularly through the Africa Programme which has provided an important framework for colleagues to share skills and expertise. These enduring partnerships have enabled the Museum to engage in sustained and open dialogues concerning the Benin collections.
The Museum is committed to active engagement with Nigerian institutions concerning the Benin Bronzes, including pursuing and supporting new initiatives developed in collaboration with Nigerian partners and colleagues.
This includes full participation in the Benin Dialogue Group and working towards the aim of facilitating a new permanent display of Benin works of art in Benin City, to include works from the British Museum's collections. The Museum is also a fully committed partner within the Digital Benin initiative, focused on developing an online tool and database to digitally reunite as many as possible of the historical objects, documents, and photographs that illuminate the Benin Kingdom.
The Museum is also committed to thorough and open investigation of Benin collection histories, and engagement with wider contemporary dialogues within which these collections are positioned. This includes fully acknowledging and understanding the colonial history which provided the key context for the development of the Museum's Benin collections.
Where else can they be seen?
In Nigeria objects from the Kingdom of Benin are housed in the collections of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), and displayed in museums in Benin City and in Lagos. However, the most significant collections are held outside Nigeria.
Various other institutions holding Benin collections are found around the world, including in the USA where there are important collections in Chicago, Boston, New York, Denver and Philadelphia.
Along with the British Museum and the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin, the following European and UK Museums with collections from the Kingdom of Benin are also participants in the Benin Dialogue Group: Weltmuseum, Vienna, Austria; Museum am Rothenbaum, Hamburg, Germany; Staatliche Kunstammlungen, Dresden, Germany; Museum für Völkerkunde, Dresden, Germany; GRASSI Museum für Völkerkunde zu Leipzig,

SOMETHING GRAVE HAPPENED AND IMPERIAL RULE OF LAW IS SUSTAINING IT!
In 1897 a great tragedy befell the kingdom of Benin when a British punitive expedition looted the treasury of treasures in the royal palace and plundered artefacts including those of great spirituality to the Bini people. Benin kingdom is now part of Nigeria and since Independence in 1960 Nigeria and also the Benin Royal Court have been anxious for the return of iconic and spiritual ones among the plundered cultural objects. The efforts have until recently been unsuccessful. President Emmanuel Macron of France in his Ouagadougou declaration has given momentum to the issue of restitution. Various arguments have been used to dismiss the requests. They include: public international law at the time permitted the seizure and preserving the status of universal museums in the various European countries. These ignore the concepts of what is right and wrong, and the need for ethics based repatriation. The paper examines the issues and concludes that only insistence on imperial rule of law or illegal rule of law can sustain the long standing refusal to contemplate restitution.
The Age of Plunder
The Greek historian Polybius (202-120 BC) wrote that the laws and the right of war oblige the victor to ruin and destroy fortresses, forts, towns, people, ships, resources and all other such like things belonging to the
*Faculty of Law, University of Ibadan, Ibadan. Paper delivered at International Conference “Museum Collections in Motion”, Cologne, Germany, 15th-17th July 2019.
enemy in order to undermine his strength while increasing the victor’s own. But the pointless destruction of temples, statutes and other sacred objects is the action of a madman. The aim of warfare for the Romans was conquest, and conquest was accompanied by massacres, destruction and pillage. Cicero on the other hand recommended moderation in pillage saying that it was not right for people to pillage for themselves but only to enrich or embellish their motherland. The situation in the Middle Ages was not very different. Towns, villages, castles and even churches were destroyed. The Germanic armies and the Crusaders; laid everything waste as they went. The church attempted to mitigate the consequences of war but did not forbid it, even though Saint Augustine had preached that the taking of booty was a sin. To protect churches, the Germanic emperor, Frederick I (1152-94) promulgated an edict in 1158 by which he forbade pillage. This edict and other prohibitions issued at the same time were little heeded. On the contrary, rules and customs concerning the division of booty multiplied.[1]
The Age of Reason
The first stirrings of a wish to protect works of art were to be seen at the Renaissance. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the first references to the protection of cultural property appeared among writers on international law. Jacob Przyluski, for example, put forward the idea that every belligerent should show regard for a work of art, but not solely because of its religious nature. Alberic and Justin Gentilis held similar ideas. Beginning with the Peace of Westphalia (1648), we find more and more clauses providing for the restoration of things to their places of origin, first of archives alone and then of works of art, displaced in the course of war.[2]
Thus appropriation of a nation’s art treasures has always been regarded as a trophy of war which adds to the glory of the victor and the humiliation of the vanquished. The practice has however often been condemned in the past going back to classical times. It is suffice to cite two modern (i.e. non classical) examples. In 1812, Sir Alexander Croke had a collection of prints and paintings returned to the Philadelphia Academy of Arts on the grounds that the arts and sciences are recognized by all civilized countries as forming an exception to the strict laws of war. To return them would therefore be in conformity with the law of nations, as practised by all civilized countries. During the wars at the time of the French Revolution, the booty of war included objets d’art and scientific objects. Restitution was made in 1815 of some of the items received as booty, when the Duke of Wellington declared that these annexations had been contrary to the practice of war between civilized nations. Similarly Lord Castlereagh in a memorandum circulated at the peace conference, maintained that the removal of works of art to France by Napoleon was “contrary to every principle of justice and to the usages of modern warfare.”[3]
Back to the Age of Plunder in Africa
In 1897 a British expedition led by Consul James R. Phillips tried to reach Benin City in today’s Nigeria. It was motivated by the British desire to put an end to the restriction on British trade which had been imposed by the Oba (King) of Benin. In a letter written in November 1896 to the Under-Secretary of State in London, Phillips indicated that “sufficient ivory may be found in the King’s house to pay for the expenses incurred in removing the King from his stool.”[4] The expedition was ambushed on its way to Benin City and seven out of nine members were killed. The British reaction was swift. The city was invaded and the palace where some tens of thousands of works of art in wood, ivory and bronze were kept was looted and eventually burnt down. The King was banished. The thousands of art pieces involved were first removed to London as spoils of war from where they were dispersed throughout the world. Many of the bronzes were sold by the British at auction to defray the expenses of the expedition. And “it was really owing to the initiative of the Germans, who secured the majority of the work for their own museums, that Benin became famous.”[5] The importance of the Benin pieces was immediately recognised by the early German Africanist Felix von Luschan. Writing in 1919, he described them in glowing terms: “Benvenuto Cellini could not have cast them better and nobody else either, before or since Cellini … These bronzes are technically of the highest quality possible.”[6] The result of the auction is that the bronzes and plaques have been scattered all over the world in museums and private collections, and is almost inaccessible to an African audience.[7]
The Rape of Maqdala
The article in The Economist of 10 July 1999, captioned “Let’s Have Our Treasure Back, Please”[8], opened with the following account of the plunder of Ethiopia’s cultural treasures in 1868 by British forces: It took 15 elephants and 200 mules to carry off the loot from Ethiopia’s old capital, Magdala. The brutal sacking of the mountain-top city in 1868, Britain’s revenge on Emperor Tewodros for taking the British consul and a few other European hostages, razed the city to the ground. The hostages were released unharmed but the battle turned into a massacre and treasure hunt. Tewodros committed suicide and British soldiers stripped his body naked for souvenirs. They carted off his library and the treasures from a Coptic Christian church nearby. For £4, Richard Holmes, the British army’s “archaeologist”, acquired the crown of the Abun, the head of the Ethiopian church, and a solid gold chalice from a soldier who had looted them. The booty was collected and auctioned off near Magdala. Holmes bought 350 illuminated bibles and manuscripts for the British Museum. Other books went to the royal library at Windsor and libraries at Oxford and Cambridge. They are still there, though odd treasures have been returned – usually the less valuable one – as gestures, whenever the British needed to court Ethiopia.
BBC’s account of the sacking of Maqdala repeats that the British needed 15 elephants and 200 mules to carry away the treasures. It goes on to give its own details of the bounty carried away: “The forces left with more than 500 ancient parchment manuscripts, two gold crowns, crosses and chalices in gold, silver and copper, religious icons, royal and ecclesiastical vestments as well as shields and arms made between the 14th and 19th centuries.”[9]
The civilized world has truly been extraordinarily brutal in her treatment of Africa and Africans. When the Italians carried to Italy as spoils of war the Obelisk Axum and the statue of Lion of Judah they were doing these things in the best tradition of Western unbridled imperialism.
The British have indeed on occasions returned some of the Maqdala loot. They include the manuscript Kebra Nagast, or “Glory of Kings” which embodied the legend of the Ethiopian ruling dynasty’s origin. Apparently they looted two copies of the MSS and returned the inferior copy.[10]
International Law
The international rules preventing pillage were only codified in 1899 by the Hague Convention on the Laws of War (“Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land.”) It was supplemented by 1907 Hague Convention on Laws and Customs of War on Land. The 1907 Convention made few major improvements from the 1899 Convention. Article 47 of the 1899 Convention simply states: “Pillage is formally prohibited.” Article 56 provides that:
The property of the communes, that of religious, charitable and educational institutions, and those of arts and science, even when state property, shall be treated as private property. All seizure of and destruction, or intentional damage done to such institutions, to historical monuments, works of art or science, is prohibited, and should be made subject of proceedings.
Thus while rules of international law preventing pillage was not codified until 1899, customary international law disallowed it as we have seen in the restitutions compelled by the Duke of Wellington and Lord Castlereagh at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.[11] By 1815 then, a new premise was enunciated to denounce the French confiscation of cultural objects from occupied territories and to justify their return upon the territories liberation following Napoleon’s defeat. There was broad agreement that the French confiscations of cultural objects were contrary to contemporary rules of law and that objects could not remain in Parisian collections.[12] Clearly, at the time of the plunder of Benin City in 1897, and the rape of Maqdala earlier in 1868 the British rampages were contrary to customary international law. They happened because customary international law did not apply to Africans. As Ana Vrdoljak put it:[13]
From the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to the mid twentieth century, victorious European powers sanctioned the restitution of cultural objects to territories restored following the collapse of empires. However, this recognition of the need to return ‘spoliations appertaining to those territories’ following independence did not extend necessarily to the dismantling of their own empires in the late twentieth century.
She went on to expose and explore how the seeds of the egregious nature of the double standard were planted. During the 1815 Congress of Vienna, there was little or no recognition of the scale and effect of confiscations by Napoleonic forces on communities outside Europe.[14] This exclusion of non-European peoples from the application and protection of (European) International Law, and the universalisation of European international law into International Law,[15] made the brutal sackings of Maqdala and Benin City normal.
The Age of UNESCO Neutered by the Legacy of the Age of Colonial Plunder
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) was established in 1946. Its declared mission is to contribute to peace and security like its parent the United Nations through the promotion of international collaboration in education, sciences and culture. The unprecedented destruction of cultural heritage and the systematic sequestration of works of art in German-occupied countries prompted UNESCO to take urgent steps to protect cultural property during armed conflict. The treaty, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict was adopted on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956.
Immediately after the First World War, the League of Nations discussed the problem of illicit traffic in cultural heritage, particularly antiquities. By the end of the Second World War it had assumed alarming proportion. However priority was given to a treaty to protect cultural property in the event of armed conflict. In 1960 the campaign for an international instrument enabling the restitution of cultural objects to their country of origin, suspended because of the war, was put back on the international agenda by Mexico and Peru. However with the continuing influence of former metropolitan powers and their museums it became clear that the restitution of objects removed in the colonial period will not be contemplated. Consequently the 1970 UNESCO Convention compromised the rights of all peoples to their cultural heritage by accommodating the interests of former metropolitan powers.[16]
It was not until April 1964 that UNESCO appointed a committee of experts to draft recommendations for a convention on illicit traffic. Four years later the General Conference of UNESCO adopted a Resolution authorising the convening of a committee to draft a Convention. The Draft was circulated for comments by Member States. In light of comments received, it was revised and sent to a Special Committee of Governmental Experts which met in April 1970 to prepare a final draft for submission to the General Conference later that year.[17] The Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property was adopted on 14 November 1970 and entered into force on 24 April 1972.
Because of the perceived vulnerability of their museums the former metropolitan powers insisted on the inclusion of a provision confirming non-retroactivity in the 1970 Convention.[18] Whilst no explicit provision was included in the treaty, Article 15 encourages States to enter bilateral negotiations to resolve claims for cultural objects removed before the entry into force of the Convention. The reason for the anxiety of metropolitan powers is due to the fact that during the colonial period – particularly in the nineteenth and early twentieth century – colonial officials, teachers, missionaries, settlers and adventurers indulged in collecting extravaganzas of cultural objects of the conquered people all over Africa. They carried them back to the metropolis. It was another aspect of controlling the resources of the conquered people and their identity. Ana Vrdoljak referred to the phenomenon as the “collecting frenzy of European empires”[19]; Wole Soyinka adding: “The museums of Europe testify to this insatiable lust of Europe.”[20] In the 1960s and 1970s after the attainment of independence the liberated African countries sought to recover symbols of the genius of their forebears as acts of firming their regained sovereignty by regaining objects of their lost sovereignty. This explains why the twelve States that sponsored the first United Nations General Assembly resolution on the subject of cultural property “Restitution of works of art to countries victims of expropriation” (Resolution 3187 of 1973) – were all African.[21] The resolution in its preamble deplored “the wholesale removal, virtually without payment, of objets d’art from one country to another, frequently as a result of colonial or foreign occupation”; it went on to maintain in the first substantive paragraph that “the prompt restitution to a country of its works of art, monuments, museums pieces and manuscripts and documents by another country, without charge”, will constitute ‘just reparation for damage done.” In 1978, there followed “A Plea for the Return of an Irreplaceable Cultural Heritage to those who Created It”, issued by the then Director-General of UNESCO Amadou Mahtar M’Bow, himself an African. He lamented that “the vicissitudes of history” had robbed many peoples’ “priceless portion” and “irreplaceable masterpieces” of their inheritance.[22]
Regardless of the fact that the 1970 UNESCO Convention does not have any provision for the return of cultural objects removed prior to Independence, two powerful groups, chief curators or more precisely directors of European museums, and art dealers associations were decidedly against the Convention. Several art market European countries waited upwards quarter of a century before joining the 1970 Convention. They are Belgium 2009, Denmark 2003, Finland 1999, France 1997, Germany 2007, Netherlands 2009, Norway 2007, Switzerland 2003 and United Kingdom 2002. Other European countries that are both source and market countries were quicker. They include Greece 1981, Italy 1978, Portugal 1985 and Spain 1986. The United States joined in 1983. It was the adoption in 1995 of UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects that tilted the scale toward ratification of the 1970 Convention by market European countries. The UNIDROIT Convention is complementary to UNESCO 1970 Convention.
The UNIDROIT Convention is quite an advance on the UNESCO Convention. It is sufficient to cite one example. The UNIDROIT Convention challenges legal obstacles preventing the recovery of stolen cultural property once it has entered the art market. The Convention puts the burden of proof on the holder of allegedly stolen cultural object. It provides in Article 3 (1) that the “possessor of a stolen cultural object must return it,” regardless of personal involvement or knowledge of the original theft. It further denies in Article 4 (1) any compensation for the return of a cultural object unless (1) “the possessor neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known that the object was stolen.” Thus European countries decided to choose the lesser of two evils by subscribing to the 1970 Convention.
Cultural Rights as Human Rights
In 1992 the Director General of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments wrote plaintively that “former colonial masters … hold in their museums the best and the most sensitive of the colonised nation’s cultural property.” He therefore urged that “the case of cultural property plundered during the colonial era should be re-examined. There is no way the former colonies can be independent when the very basis of their existence is being colonized.”[23]
The 160 brass heads taken away by the looters among other objects are the Benin equivalent to chronological records. This is because each head represented an Oba (King), they recorded dynasties back to the twelfth century. When an Oba died, a formal head was cast in bronze as a furnishing for an altar erected to his memory. The bronzes in their thousands plundered by the 1897 punitive expedition against the Kingdom of Benin were dispersed among museums in Europe and the United States. In 2007 a magnificient exhibition Benin Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria took place in Vienna, Austria at Museum fur Volkerkunde. It later toured Musee du quai Branly, Paris; Ethnologisches Museum – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin; and The Art Institute of Chicago. In his Introductory Note to the exhibition catalogue the Oba (King) of Benin at the time, Omo N’Oba Erediauwa, wrote with a heavy heart:[24]
As you step into the exhibition hall today, you will behold some of Africa’s most exquisite works. But it is important to note that they were not originally meant to be mere museum pieces simply to be displayed for art lovers to admire. They were objects with religious and archival value to my people. They were made only under royal command. Whenever an event of significance took place, the Oba (King) commissioned the Igun-Eronmwon (members of the guild of bronze casters) to make a bronze-cast of it. Thus, the bronzes were records of events in the absence of photography. Those of the works, which were not made for record keeping, were made for a religious purpose and kept on altars. So, as you step into the hall today, you will be reading, as it were, the pages torn off from the book of a people’s life history; you will be viewing objects of our spirituality, albeit, you may not fully understand its import.
From 17-23 February 1997, activities were held in Benin to mark the centenary of the events of 1897. The Oba of Benin and grandson of the reigning Oba at the time of the invasion in his opening address alluded to the threat of some Bini to take the British government to the International Court of Justice over the event of 1897 in order to get a judgment for the British government to repatriate the looted works of art. While appreciating the good intention of such Benin people he cautioned that this is not a matter to be taken to the International Court of Justice or any court of law, even if those contemplating it could be able to finance such actions. Pointing out that success has been achieved in many international issues through what is known as quiet diplomacy, the Oba added: “At this very moment, I am happy to say, I am in contact with some eminent people in London who are supportive to our cause and seriously helping”.[25] But it was a dialogue with the deaf. In this relationship, economic considerations have always trumped human rights. The various treaties entered into by the British in West Africa did not recognise the sovereign rights of Africans to their cultural property.[26]
Economics Trumping Human Rights
Henry Cole the first director of Victoria and Albert Museum (originally known as South Kensington Museum 1852-1899) held the view that the physical possession of exemplary cultural objects was a source of national wealth.[27] Paul Bator in his 1982 then seminal Essay on the International Trade in Art, enthusiastically supported this commoditization of culture posit. He held that cultural objects are exploitable commodities and classified them as part of the national patrimony. He used a prominent example of a most contentious restitution battle to clinch his controversial case.
The Elgin Marbles are part of England’s national patrimony. All such works of art are part of the national capital: they generate income (by attracting tourists, etc.) and they can produce social and psychological benefits for a country and its inhabitants.[28]
The Bator thesis ignores the fact the best and most sensitive of African cultural heritage are in the West. While the thesis accommodates the “social and psychological benefits” of those who plundered it, it ignores the social and psychological dysfunction and deprivation of those whose ancestors made the objects. The scant attention always paid to the effect of the dispossession of former colonial peoples leaves very much to be desired. Prince Edun Akenzua, in his contribution to Whose Objects?” the catalogue of exhibition of Benin objects at the Museum of Ethnology in Stockholm on this aspect said:[29]
I should like to point out the works were not intended for museums or galleries. Most of them were made to record events in the lives of the people. In other words, they were records of our people’s life. The others were made for religious purpose and kept on altars.
President Macron’s Declaration and British Intransigence
On 28 November 2017, President Emmanuel Macron of France speaking to students at the University of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, said: “I cannot accept that a large part of the cultural heritage of several African countries is in France…. I want conditions to be met within five years for temporary or definitive restitutions of African heritage to Africa.”[30] Three major European countries with a colonial past in Africa; Belgium, Germany and Netherlands have since announced between 2018 and 2019 that they would consider restitution of cultural objects in colonial collections which had been looted during the colonial period. For example, in March 2019 the culture Ministers of Germany’s 16 States agree to create conditions for the repatriation of African colonial cultural objects in public collections that were taken “in ways that are legally or morally unjustifiable today.” They described their return as “an ethical and moral duty.”[31] The British however remain obdurate. Mr. Jeremy Wright Britain’s Culture Secretary was reported by the London Sunday Times to have rejected President Macron’s view that African cultural objects should be returned to their countries of origin. He argued that there is real cultural benefit to the world in seeing objects from different civilizations in one place. If you follow the logic of restitution to its logical conclusion, there would be no single points where people can see multiple things he added.[32] But it is simply scaremongering and not true that anyone wishes to push the restitution project to its logical conclusion. The universal museum pretext is now quite discredited and the British resistance is indeed pitiful and deplorable. They are not the only country with universal museums. And they must stop being in denial of the crimes of colonialism.
Imperial Rule of Law
The non recognition of sovereign rights of Africans to their cultural property condoned by the various treaties with the kingdoms that are now part of Nigeria, and the non applicability of customary international law to Africans and other colonised peoples laid the foundation of the imperial rule of law. It is now taken for granted by some curators that the Benin Bronzes no longer belong to the people of Benin. Two jarring examples will be given. In 2010 the booklet of the Benin objects exhibited at the Museum of Ethnography, Stockholm, is facetiously titled Whose Objects? One is reminded of the effrontery for several decades of naming the marbles plundered from the Acropolis after the plunderer Elgin christening them Elgin Marbles! If this can be done to a fellow European country (Greece) in the name of chauvinism why can it not be done to a country of “lesser breeds without the Law?” as Rudyard Kipling, the poet of British Imperialism put it in his 1897 poem Recessional.[33]
The second example is from the Benin Dialogue Group. In December 2010 the workshop “New Cultures of Collaboration. Sharing of Collections and Quests for Restitution: the Benin Case” was organized in Vienna at the Museum of Ethnology. The workshop was between Nigerian museums officials and curators of European museums including British Museum, Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, and Museum of Ethnography Stockholm. The Group has met five times in Vienna, Berlin, Benin City, University of Cambridge, and Leiden. In its statement at the conclusion of the last meeting in Leiden in 2018 the Group did a somersault and abandoned the issue of restitution which was a prominent feature of the first meeting in Vienna. The Group declared that it “is not part of the business of the Benin Dialogue Group” to concern itself with “the eventual return of works of art removed from the Royal Court of Benin.”[34]
Nigeria has emphasized the moral duty of current holders of the Benin objects to atone for their plundering of the cultural heritage of Africa during the colonial period, or being accessory after the fact. Specifically in his letter to the British Parliament Prince Akenzua contended that Britain being the principal looters of the Benin Palace, should take responsibility for retrieving the cultural property of the Bini or pay monetary compensation.[35]
The response of the British Museum for the return of the Benin Bronzes has always been legalistic as it is in the case of the Parthenon Sculptures. And it is flawed. The British argument brings to mind the dark side of the rule of law as documented by Ugo Mattei and Laura Nader in Plunder: When the Rule of Law is Illegal.[36] Using the concept of the rule of law to justify non-return is tantamount to justifying illegality with the aid of imperial rule of law that demeans the “lesser breeds without the Law”.
UNESCO Conventions on cultural heritage emphasize that cultural property belongs to all humanity. It was a small step to arguing that as a matter of human rights cultural objects expropriated in the colonial period should be returned. Indeed, in 1981 a member of UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation from Panama who was unable to attend the second session of the Intergovernmental Committee in a telex message read to the session concluded it by asserting: “The right [of dispossessed countries] to the cultural heritage is one of human rights, let us defend it.”[37] M’Bow in his 1978 Plea had argued that: “The men and women of these countries have the right to recover these cultural assets which are part of their being.”[38] On 7 December 1999, Theo-Ben Gurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia and also at the time President of the United Nations General Assembly in a discussion in the General Assembly on the issue of return of cultural objects maintained that “the lapse of time did not diminish ownership or the need for restitution.”[39]
Restitution is the proper solution to the return of iconic cultural objects wrongfully acquired in colonial times and in war. Whatever the legal basis of these acquisitions in international law, the usurpation of the identity and history of a people should be seen as intolerable and genuine efforts made to reverse the supremacy of the rule of plunder. Legal Darwinism should give way to true rule of law.

The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution
Tue, February 16 @ 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
A presentation with discussion with author Dan Hicks
The story of the Benin Bronzes — carried off by the British in 1897 — sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonization of museums. In The Brutish Museums, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.
Walk into the Met Museum on NYC’s “Museum Mile” and the curated plunder of American imperialism adorns the halls and galleries. Dan’s book calls for western museums to wash their hands of colonial bloodshed. More importantly it is a call to action for all of us — museum workers, artists, casual observers and anti-imperialist activists — to empty these palaces of plunder and simply send the looted items back.
DAN HICKS is Professor of Contemporary Archaeology at the University of Oxford and Curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum. His award-winning research focuses on the restitution of African cultural heritage from Euro-American collections, focusing on the place of ideas of cultural whiteness in ongoing histories of colonial violence.
“A startling act of conscience. An important book which could overturn what people have felt about British history, empire, civilisation, Africa, and African art. It is with books like this that cultures are saved, by beginning truthfully to face the suppressed and brutal past. It has fired a powerful shot into the debate about cultural restitution. You will never see many European museums in the same way again. Books like this give one hope that a new future is possible.” — Ben Okri
“Dan, your words brought tears to my eyes. I salute you” — MC Hammer

«The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution» by Dan Hicks
March 8, 2021, 16h00 (GMT)
Online
Overview
Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date, and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen. Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of brass plaques and carved ivory tusks depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless privare collections. The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.

71,Berlin plans to hand back Benin bronzes to Nigeria by autumn ...,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/23/berlin-plans-hand-back-benin-bronzes-nigeria-autumn-piling-pressure/,"Berlin is planning to hand back its Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, piling pressure on the British Museum to return its own world-class holdings.
Germany is moving towards full restitution of its looted treasures, a foreign ministry official revealed yesterday.
Hundreds of bronzes from the ancient Kingdom of Benin, located in modern-day Nigeria - a former British colony - are held at the Ethnological Museum in the German capital. They were due to be unveiled at the Humboldt Forum, a new museum of non-European art in the city centre.
But Hartmut Dorgerloh, the Humboldt’s director, confirmed that they could instead be returned to Nigeria by the autumn.
Andreas Görgen, the head of the Foreign Ministry’s culture department, visited Benin City last week for discussions with Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and other Nigerian officials, the Art Newspaper reported yesterday, although terms are yet to be finalised.
The Benin Bronzes were looted in 1897. Weeks after British military officers, colonial officials and traders were ambushed and killed by local soldiers, British troops took revenge, exiling the king and helping themselves to thousands of objects, including statues, commemorative heads and ivory carvings.
Barnaby Phillips, author of a forthcoming book, “Loot: Britain and the Benin Bronzes”, said that this will put pressure on Britain and that the British Museum - which boasts the world’s biggest collection of Benin Bronzes.
He said: “If other museums are giving back [their bronzes], the British Museum will look out of step.”
The British Museum rotates its displays and makes all objects available for study, he pointed out that it is also bound by legal constraints. “Neither the director nor the board of trustees could return the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria without Parliament voting to change the law,"" he said.
“Ultimately, it would be down to politics. If you see the kinds of things [culture secretary] Oliver Dowden has said, warning British museums not to hand over their crown jewels, let alone sponsoring a vote in Parliament that the Government would support, I can’t see that happening. So this is awkward for the British Museum.”
He noted that the British Museum and several institutions have already hashed out a careful compromise with the Nigerian authorities, with a consortium of European museums agreeing to loan back 300 Benin Bronzes.
Dan Hicks, a curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which holds about 150 Benin objects taken in 1897, said: “Time’s up for simply ignoring these longstanding claims.""
He added: “It will come as a surprise to some people that the move towards restitution of objects that were taken by the British… is coming from a museum in Germany. In many ways, that shows us that so many of these objects are not only in the British Museum.
""In fact only eight per cent of more than 10,000 objects that were taken in 1897 are now in the British Museum. The rest are in 160 or more museums around the world. What this signals is that each one of those museums, including 45 here in the UK, will now be having their own conversations.”
In a statement, the British Museum said: “The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged by the Museum and the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects explained in gallery panels and on the Museum’s website.
“We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world.”",,2021-03-23,berlin planning hand back benin bronze nigeria pile pressure british museum return world class holding germany move towards full restitution loot treasure foreign ministry official reveal yesterday hundred bronze ancient kingdom benin locate modern day nigeria former british colony held ethnological museum german capital due unveiled humboldt forum new museum non european art city centre hartmut dorgerloh humboldt director confirm could instead return nigeria autumn andreas görgen head foreign ministry culture department visit benin city last week discussion edo state governor godwin obaseki nigerian official art newspaper report yesterday although term yet finalise benin bronze loot 1897 week british military officer colonial official trader ambush kill local soldier british troop take revenge exile king help thousand object include statue commemorative head ivory carving barnaby phillips author forthcoming book loot britain benin bronze say put pressure britain british museum boast world big collection benin bronze say if museum give back their bronze british museum look step british museum rotates display make object available study point also bound legal constraint neither director board trustee could return benin bronze nigeria without parliament voting change law say ultimately would politics see kind thing culture secretary oliver dowden say warn british museum hand crown jewel let alone sponsor vote parliament government would support cant see happen awkward british museum note british museum several institution already hash careful compromise nigerian authority consortium european museum agree loan back 300 benin bronze dan hick curator pitt river museum oxford hold 150 benin object take 1897 say time simply ignore longstanding claim add it come surprise people move towards restitution object take british come museum germany many way show many object british museum in fact eight per cent 10000 object take 1897 british museum rest 160 museum around world signal one museum include 45 uk conversation statement british museum say the devastation plunder wreak upon benin city british military expedition 1897 fully acknowledge museum circumstance around acquisition benin object explain gallery panel museum website we believe strength british museum collection resides breadth depth allow million visitor understand culture world,berlin plan hand back benin bronz nigeria pile pressur british museum return world class hold germani move toward full restitut loot treasur foreign ministri offici reveal yesterday hundr bronz ancient kingdom benin locat modern day nigeria former british coloni held ethnolog museum german capit due unveil humboldt forum new museum non european art citi centr hartmut dorgerloh humboldt director confirm could instead return nigeria autumn andrea görgen head foreign ministri cultur depart visit benin citi last week discuss edo state governor godwin obaseki nigerian offici art newspap report yesterday although term yet finalis benin bronz loot 1897 week british militari offic coloni offici trader ambush kill local soldier british troop took reveng exil king help thousand object includ statu commemor head ivori carv barnabi phillip author forthcom book loot britain benin bronz said put pressur britain british museum boast world biggest collect benin bronz said if museum give back their bronz british museum look step british museum rotat display make object avail studi point also bound legal constraint neither director board truste could return benin bronz nigeria without parliament vote chang law said ultim would polit see kind thing cultur secretari oliv dowden said warn british museum hand crown jewel let alon sponsor vote parliament govern would support cant see happen awkward british museum note british museum sever institut alreadi hash care compromis nigerian author consortium european museum agre loan back 300 benin bronz dan hick curat pitt river museum oxford hold 150 benin object taken 1897 said time simpli ignor longstand claim ad it come surpris peopl move toward restitut object taken british come museum germani mani way show mani object british museum in fact eight per cent 10000 object taken 1897 british museum rest 160 museum around world signal one museum includ 45 uk convers statement british museum said the devast plunder wreak upon benin citi british militari expedit 1897 fulli acknowledg museum circumst around acquisit benin object explain galleri panel museum websit we believ strength british museum collect resid breadth depth allow million visitor understand cultur world

Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen. Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections. The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museum, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.

 The Man Who Restituted His Grandfather's Looted Benin Bronzes 
  ADDTHIS BUTTON BEGIN   ADDTHIS BUTTON END  
 
 BBC NEWS has published an article under the title of “The man who returned his grandfather’s looted art”, recounting the recent return of two Benin Bronzes by Dr. Mark Walker, a medical surgeon and a descendant of one of the British soldiers who invaded Benin City in 1897 and plundered the precious artefacts from the palace of the Oba of Benin. (1)   
 ""These objects are part of the cultural heritage of another people… to the people of Benin City, these objects are priceless."" - Dr. Mark Walker.   
 No doubt many readers would have already heard about Mark Walker but the story by Ellen Otzen is worth reading for there are not many persons in the Western world who, plagued by their conscience for holding looted art of other peoples, are in a hurry to return the objects to the legitimate owners. Since Walker returned two Benin Bronzes last year, there has not been a similar gesture in the whole of the Western world. This is a sad commentary on the prevailing morality. But this should not come as a surprise since in this 21st Century we have powerful institutions and leading academics that seriously argue that artefacts that have been wrenched from former colonies with violence and other illegitimate methods should be kept by the holders in the West. This position provides evidence and confirmation that not everyone has rejected colonialism and its effects despite the various United Nations resolutions. Many Western scholars seem to have banned morality from discussions on restitution.   
 Walker who inherited two Benin Bronzes from his grandfather felt it would be the right thing to return the objects to the descendants of Oba Ovonramwen from whose palace the objects were looted. He felt the people of Benin needed those objects more than the people at home in Britain. When Walker arrived with the two objects in Benin City, he was overwhelmed by the warm and enthusiastic reception he received from the 92 years old Oba, a great grandson of Oba Ovonramwen and from the people of Benin:   
 "" It was very humbling to be greeted with such enthusiasm and gratitude, for nothing really. I was just returning some art objects to a place where I feel they will be properly looked after .”    
 As we have always maintained, African artefacts mean more to the African peoples than to the Westerners who hold these objects mostly for aesthetic contemplation and economic gain. (2)   
 The BBC News report contains certain statements which we must comment on for the better understanding of the invasion of Benin and its aftermath.   
 “ But in January 1897, seven British officials who were on their way to see the Oba of Benin – the king – were killed in an ambush ”.    
 The history of this unwelcome visit which proved fatal should be clarified. Captain Philips had requested a visit to the Oba who replied he could not receive him because he would be involved in sacred ceremonies during which time no foreigners were permitted to see the Oba. Philips and his group were equally warned by chiefs who were well disposed to the British to refrain from the journey. Despite all warnings, Philip and his group proceeded with the visit as planned.  Philips and his group with some 120-200 personnel disguised as carriers but having arms in their boxes, had as undeclared objective: to depose Oba Ovonramvem who was considered by the Acting Consul- General Philips as the main obstacle to Britain gaining control over trade in that part of Nigeria. Instead of the surprise attack the British group intended to launch, they were themselves surprised by an ambush on their way. Readers must ask themselves since when can one visit another person who says clearly that the tine proposed is inconvenient? Since when does one vist a monarch who states he is not prepared to receive such a visit?   
 The attack on Philips and his group provided a welcome pretext for invasion which the British had been weighing for a long time, including discussing the possible sale of Benin artworks to defray the costs of the intended campaign. British troops were sent to Benin on what they called Punitive Expedition. (3). Benin City was captured and burnt. The Oba sent into exile in Calabar, in Nigeria. The destruction in Benin must have been awful. R. H. Bacon, Intelligence Officer to the expedition wrote in his book,  Benin: the City of Blood :   
 "" There was a dim grandeur about it all, and also these seemed to a fate. Here was this head centre of iniquity, spared by us from its suitable end of burning for the sake of holding the new seat of justice where barbarism had held away, given into our hands with the brand of Blood soaked into every corner and ........ fire only could purge it, and here on our lassa day we were to see its legitimate fate overtake it ."" (4)   
 “ After the killing came the looting – the British seized more than 2,000 artworks and religious artefacts, most of them hundreds of years old, which were sent back to England .”    
 The figure of 2000 mentioned as the number of the looted artefacts seems to us an underestimate. Prof. Felix von Luschan who was instrumental in procuring a large number of the Benin artefacts for the Ethnologische Museum, Berlin, puts the figure at 2400. We prefer to use the figure of 3000 used by Edun Akenzua, the brother of the Oba in his plea to the British Parliament. But there is no officially agreed figure. The Oba did not keep a list of his artefacts nor are the Western museums willing to give us exact figures of the number of Benin artefacts they are holding. The Germans have officially stated 507 as the number they have. Field Museum, Chicago once indicated holding 404 Benin artefacts but nobody now knows where those artefacts are. The British Museum does not give any official information at all on its number of Benin artefacts some of which the venerable museum has in the meanwhile sold for cash. (5)    
 The BBC News report contains a classic response from the British Museum on why it is not willing to return any of the many looted Benin Bronzes it is holding   
 The British Museum says it has not recently received any new official requests for the return of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.   
 “ As a museum of the world for the world the British Museum presents the Benin Bronzes in a global context alongside the stories of other cultures and makes these objects as available as possible to a global audience ,” it says in a statement.    
 As usual, the British Museum presents first a denial that there has been a request and then advances a reason why it is justified in holding looted artefacts. We should note that the museum has made a modification to the usual denial of the existence of a request. For a long time, the museum simply denied that there had ever been a request at all for the Benin Bronzes even though the evidence for the demand was overwhelming. The Oba of Benin and the Nigerian Government and Parliament have for decades requested the return of the looted artefacts.    
 Various groups within and outside Nigeria have also made such request. The United Nations and UNESCO have since 1972 annually passed a resolution entitled “Return Cultural Property to country of Origin urging holding countries to return the objects. (6)The International Council of Museums has requested holding museums to take initiative in returning cultural objects. Several writers have also made such a request. The Oba of Benin sent his brother in 2000 to make an appeal to the British Parliament which is on the records of the British Parliament, known as Appendix 21. Still the British Museum denied there had been any request. (7)   
 The reported defence of the Bloomsbury museum is that “ it has not recently received any new official requests for the return of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria .” We are dealing here with objects looted in 1897. How recent must the request for return be? Is the request in 2000 before the British Parliament not recent enough? Must the Oba of Benin and his people renew the request every year or month? What about the requests made by the Oba at the opening of the various Benin exhibitions, ""Benin-Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria""? The exhibition was in Vienna from 9thMay to 3rd September, 2007, in Paris from 2nd October to 6th January 2008, in Berlin from 7th February to 25th May, 2008 and in Chicago from 27th June to 21st September 2008.   
 Do the annual United Nations/UNESCO resolutions then not matter at all? (8) We should note however the progress made by the museum from a blatant denial of the existence of a demand for return to absence of recent demand.   
 The claim that the British Museum is “ a museum of the world for the world ” is simply not true and people at Bloomsbury know this very well. The museum has not been created by any world authority with participation by other States such as those in the United Nations and other international organizations. The British Museum is a British museum created by the British Parliament through an Act of the British Parliament, British Museum Act 1753 as subsequently modified by British Museum Act 1963.  The Board of Trustees of the museum are appointed by the British Monarch and the British Government. No doubt the museum has high or world standards but that does not make it a world museum. There are several museums in the world with such standards but none will make such claims.(9) The big difference between the museum in Bloomsbury and other important museums is that the British Museum has looted/stolen artefacts from several parts of the world. In that sense, one may consider it a museum of the world but could one claim such a distinction on the basis of illegality?   
 Even if the British Museum were a “museum of the world for the world”, it would not be entitled, by this fact, to hold onto artefacts of other peoples, obtained through violence and the use of force who now request their return. The acquisition of” world status” cannot be advanced to deny the basic human right to cultural development.   
 But who requested the British Museum to present “ the Benin Bronzes in a global context alongside the stories of other cultures ” and “ make these objects as available as possible to a global audience ” whilst denying to the people of Benin access to their own artefacts?   
 We can see from the argument of the British Museum the urgent need to tell the story of Dr, Mark Walker as often as possible so that all may finally understand that every people creates its artefacts for its own use and should not through violence and other oppressive means be deprived of the basic human right to cultural development and self-determination of the location of cultural artefacts.   
 By his noble gesture, Mark Walker has restored our confidence in the ability of humankind to distinguish between right and wrong, justice and injustice; he has positioned himself beyond petty economics and the parochial nationalism that presents itself in the disguise of universalism, using arrogance and mendacity as its favourite tools.   
 "" Culture is the soul of a nation. The illicit removal or destruction of cultural property deprives peoples of their history and tradition. Restitution is the only means that can restore damage and reinstate a sense of dignity. ” - Anastassis Mitsialis, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations on the Presentation of  the Resolution titled, Return or restitution of cultural property to the country of origin GA/RES/67/80, 12 Dec. 2012.

 APPENDIX 21   
 The Case of Benin   
 Memorandum submitted by Prince Edun Akenzua    
 I am Edun Akenzua Enogie (Duke) of Obazuwa-Iko, brother of His Majesty, Omo, n'Oba n'Edo, Oba (King) Erediauwa of Benin, great grandson of His Majesty Omo n'Oba n'Edo, Oba Ovonramwen, in whose reign the cultural property was removed in 1897. I am also the Chairman of the Benin Centenary Committee established in 1996 to commemorate 100 years of Britain's invasion of Benin, the action which led to the removal of the cultural property.    
 HISTORY   
 ""On 26 March 1892 the Deputy Commissioner and Vice-Consul, Benin District of the Oil River Protectorate, Captain H L Gallwey, manoeuvred Oba Ovonramwen and his chiefs into agreeing to terms of a treaty with the British Government. That treaty, in all its implications, marked the beginning of the end of the independence of Benin not only on account of its theoretical claims, which bordered on the fictitious, but also in providing the British with the pretext, if not the legal basis, for subsequently holding the Oba accountable for his future actions.""    
 The text quoted above was taken from the paper presented at the Benin Centenary Lectures by Professor P A Igbafe of the Department of History, University of Benin on 17 February 1997.   
 Four years later in 1896 the British Acting Consul in the Niger-Delta, Captain James R Philip wrote a letter to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Salisbury, requesting approval for his proposal to invade Benin and depose its King. As a post-script to the letter, Captain Philip wrote: ""I would add that I have reason to hope that sufficient ivory would be found in the King's house to pay the expenses incurred in removing the King from his stool.""   
 These two extracts sum up succinctly the intention of the British, or, at least, of Captain Philip, to take over Benin and its natural and cultural wealth for the British.   
 British troops invaded Benin on 10 February1897. After a fierce battle, they captured the city, on February 18. Three days later, on 21 February precisely, they torched the city and burnt down practically every house. Pitching their tent on the Palace grounds, the soldiers gathered all the bronzes, ivory-works, carved tusks and oak chests that escaped the fire. Thus, some 3,000 pieces of cultural artwork were taken away from Benin. The bulk of it was taken from the burnt down Palace.   
 NUMBER OF ITEMS REMOVED    
 It is not possible for us to say exactly how many items were removed. They were not catalogued at inception. We are informed that the soldiers who looted the palace did the cataloguing. It is from their accounts and those of some European and American sources that we have come to know that the British carried away more than 3,000 pieces of Benin cultural property. They are now scattered in museums and galleries all over the world, especially in London, Scotland, Europe and the United States. A good number of them are in private hands.   
 WHAT THE WORKS MEAN TO THE PEOPLE OF BENIN    
 The works have been referred to as primitive art, or simply, artifacts of African origin. But Benin did not produce their works only for aesthetics or for galleries and museums. At the time Europeans were keeping their records in long-hand and in hieroglyphics, the people of Benin cast theirs in bronze, carved on ivory or wood. The Obas commissioned them when an important event took place which they wished to record. Some of them of course, were ornamental to adorn altars and places of worship. But many of them were actually reference points, the library or the archive. To illustrate this, one may cite an event which took place during the coronation of Oba Erediauwa in 1979. There was an argument as to where to place an item of the coronation paraphernalia. Fortunately a bronze-cast of a past Oba wearing the same regalia had escaped the eyes of the soldiers and so it is still with us. Reference was made to it and the matter was resolved. Taking away those items is taking away our records, or our Soul.   
 RELIEF SOUGHT    
 In view of the fore-going, the following reliefs are sought on behalf of the Oba and people of Benin who have been impoverished, materially and psychologically, by the wanton looting of their historically and cultural property.   
 (i)  The official record of the property removed from the Palace of Benin in 1897 be made available to the owner, the Oba of Benin.   
 (ii)  All the cultural property belonging to the Oba of Benin illegally taken away by the British in 1897, should be returned to the rightful owner, the Oba of Benin.   
 (iii)  As an alternative, to (ii) above, the British should pay monetary compensation, based on the current market value, to the rightful owner, the Oba of Benin.   
 (iv)  Britain, being the principal looters of the Benin Palace, should take full responsibility for retrieving the cultural property or the monetary compensation from all those to whom the British sold them.

 Annex 2   
 List of Holders of the Benin Bronzes   
 Almost every Western museum has some Benin objects. Here is a short list of museums where some of the Benin Bronzes are to be found and their numbers. Various catalogues of exhibitions on Benin art or African art also list the private collections of the Benin Bronzes. The museums refuse to inform the public about the number of Benin artefacts they have and do not display permanently the Benin artefacts in their possession since they do not have enough space. A museum such as Völkerkunde Museum, Vienna (Now World Museum) has closed since 12 years and is not likely to re-open soon. The looted Benin artefacts are in the African Section.    
 German authorities still have to explain the disparity between 507 objects they now admit and the figure of 580 given by Prof. Felix van Luschan who was instrumental in procuring the Benin Bronzes for the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin. Has the German museum, like the British Museum also sold some of the Benin artefacts? See K, Opoku, "" Did Germans Never Hear Directly or Indirectly Nigeria’s Demand for Return of Looted Artefacts? ""

77,"Restitution, Repatriation, and Decolonization: What's Next For ...",https://glasstire.com/2020/12/28/restitution-repatriation-and-decolonization-whats-next-for-brutish-museums/,"Museums are having a moment of cultural reckoning.
Across Europe and the United States, museums — specifically art, anthropology, ethnography, and history museums — are being asked about and expected to publicly address the oft-problematic legacies of their collections as well as their institutions. As historic entities, museums are inexorably and inescapably bound up in their histories of colonialism, white supremacy, extractive capitalism, and militant nationalism. Consequently, museums are not socially or politically neutral spaces; they stabilize and reproduce certain narratives and repress others. The items that are on display in such spaces and that make up collections are now in a very public spotlight as visitors, donors, curators, politicians, and scholars try — or not! — to reconcile the cultural power museums wield and how objects are displayed, why, and what histories they are being used to tell.
The Benin Bronzes are one such set of objects.
In February 1897, the British Navy launched a “punitive expedition” against Benin City, brutally subjugating the West African Kingdom of Benin as a colony of the British Empire. (Such punitive expeditions were part of the “small wars” that were an ever-present part of Victorian Britain.) An aggressive campaign engineered by Britain to its economic advantage, the campaign pitted 5,000 European (and African) troops, with millions of bullets and Maxim machine guns, against Benin soldiers with flintlock guns and knives. The losses suffered by Benin’s soldiers are incalculable — in no small part because Britain chose not to record the dead, let alone the displaced or wounded. British soldiers looted and burned their way through the city, plundering pieces of art from Benin City’s Royal Court of the Obas.
While it is difficult to quantify how many items were plundered, contemporary estimates put the number around 10,000 items. These brass plaques, bronze sculptures, and carved ivory tusks left the Kingdom of Benin to be passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum, and a plethora of private collectors. With notably few exceptions, the stolen items have not been returned.
Today, the “Benin Bronzes” — the collective name to the looted artifacts from the 1897 expedition — are at the heart of debate about cultural restitution, repatriation, and decolonization of museums. In his book Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution, Oxford archaeologist and Pitt River Museum curator of World Archaeology Dan Hicks, offers a passionate, unflinching critique of how the continued presence of the Benin Bronzes in British museums and national collections perpetuates the colonial violence that “acquired” them in the first place. “Each stolen object is an unfinished event, its density grows with each passing hour,” Hicks argues. “Ten thousand unfinished events.”
It’s easy to treat objects in museums as “finished” things — to assume that what we’re looking at when we see on item in a display case is a completed, final object. Something simply to be owned by a museum and admired by a public. This narrow definition of what an object is and how it “ought” to be means that it is impossible to imagine a museum-held object anywhere other than, well, in a museum. The future of such objects appears straightforward — museum, museum, museum.
For decades, traditional “object histories” suggest that it’s the life before the museum that requires explanation and history, but once a thing is musem-ified, that’s that. If Hicks were writing a traditional “object history” of the plundered items, readers would learn a lot about the history and craft of the bronzes’ manufacture, their cultural significance, and the ways that the artifacts have circulated the world since 1897. But an object history is told through the actions of people and institutions that encounter an object throughout its material life. This sort of narrative does not presume to command repatriation for artifacts or to call for restorative justice — to address the debts of colonialism owed in the here and now.
The Brutish Museums is not an object history and ought not to be, Hicks challenges, because object histories do not force readers to confront the systematic violence and colonial subjugation that is inexorably part of an object’s 21st-century identity. Biographies of objects — often paired with concepts like “entanglement” and written to offer objects their own sort of self-actualized agency — focus on action-oriented events and overlook the pauses, silences, and absences that are just as much a part of an object’s history as are the events that are easy to describe. Each new event is a new cultural strata neatly superimposed on the one below it — to dig into the past, one need only excavate the object, much like one would an archaeological site.
Such a perspective is not only insufficient to understand the history of the Benin Bronzes, Hicks contends, it is fundamentally unethical. (As someone who writes object histories, Hicks’ staunch censure of the method’s shortcomings made me squirm to think about the silences in objects’ histories that I have blithely written through, around, and over.) Instead of writing object histories, Hicks advocates “necrographies” — death histories or histories of loss. This necrographic approach requires that the silences between events in objects’ lives be recognized. “This necrography of Benin 1897 is a forensic excavation not an anthrohistorical exercise, seeking not just to call out crimes, to count up the dead, to think ourselves back into the past like the historian — but to take action in the present,” Hicks contends, a point that puts the question of how objects are written about into the process of cultural restitution. A necrographic approach requires that audiences acknowledge the “death” associated with objects is as part of cultural restitution — as part of his necrography, Hicks offers a careful catalog of British citizens and institutions that historically took possession of the items. The approach makes object-oriented cultural biographies seem small and insignificant by comparison.
Not only does this require a theory of “taking,” it compels us to consider how “taking” in the late 19th century is part of what forms anthropological museum collections today. In other words, there are a plethora of ways to dress up and describe how looted items become part of museums’ collections; but understanding the legal means by which looted items were and are bought, accessioned, and gifted to museums underscores how museums can hide behind legal reasons for why it’s difficult to remove items from their institutions. Although it’s impossible to trace where 10,000 artifacts have scattered, Hicks offers specifics for several items and the people who took them — “a partial muster roll of the looters” — so that the necrography is as complete as possible.
Brutish Museums is a powerful call to action to both repatriate the Benin Bronzes and to begin a dialogue about the history of loss and violence that is inescapably part of the cost of British colonialism. It reminds readers that the oft-celebrated anthropology museums (“world history” or “ethnography” museums) where — and still are! — both weapons and methods of white supremacist ideology and extractive capitalist colonialism.
Any museum that isn’t taking a good, hard look at its history ought to.

78,Looted Benin Bronzes to be returned to Nigeria,https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/en/looted-benin-bronzes-to-be-returned-to-nigeria-li.156249,"Berlin - It's one of the longest-running international cultural disputes: where is the rightful home of the works of art looted by British troops in 1898 from Benin City (in modern-day Nigeria) which were then sold internationally by London art dealers?
German museums in the Benin Dialogue Group have reached an agreement on restitution, government cultural official Monika Grütters (CDU) announced on Thursday evening. The first ""substantial returns"" are to take place ""in the course of 2022"". She added that the process would take place under the ""greatest possible transparency"".
Grütters said a complete registery of all works from Benin in German museums would be compiled and the circumstances of their acquisition clarified. Not all of them ended up in museums as a result of looting. Some objects were being traded long before 1898. Others entered the art market after Nigerian independence in 1960.
British looting, German responsibility
While Benin City wasn't plundered by the Germans, Grütters said it was nonetheless a matter of facing up to ""Germany's colonial past"". The decision was ""a historic landmark in dealing with the colonial era"". The project foresees close cooperation with Nigerian authorities, civil society groups and representatives of Benin's royal family. It's expected the first results will be presented towards the end of May.
The exhibitions in Berlin's Humboldt Forum, Hamburg's former Ethnological Museum (now the MARKK), Hamburg's Museum of Art and Design and Stuttgart's Lindenmuseum will certainly be affected. It is not yet clear to what extent German museums will try to obtain works of art from Benin on loan in future and what they might offer in compensation.

More about The Brutish Museums:
Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.
Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of brass plaques and carved ivory tusks depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.
The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museums, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.

Located in the heart of the Berkeley campus, we have grown into a museum that studies the past and the present in order to encourage dialogue, understanding and respect. We facilitate connections by helping people relate to objects, cultures, and to one another. It would take years to explore everything in our care. With a collection containing millions of objects, we are constantly working to tell the stories of the cultures around us.

Walk into any Western museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.
Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.
The Brutish Museums sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. Since its first publication, museums across the western world have begun to return their Bronzes to Nigeria, heralding a new era in the way we relate to the objects of empire we once took for granted.

82,Germany to return bronze artifacts looted during African ...,https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2021/04/30/germany-to-return-bronze-artifacts-looted-during-african-colonial-era/,"BERLIN — Germany is returning hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes that were mostly looted from West Africa by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums, authorities said Friday.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas welcomed a deal reached with museums and authorities in Nigeria to work on a restitution plan for a substantial number of artifacts, calling it a “turning point in dealing with our colonial history.”
Germany’s minister for culture, Monika Gruetters, said the Benin Bronzes were a key test for the way the country deals with its colonial past.
“We are confronting our historic and moral responsibility,” she said.
Gruetters said the goal is to contribute to “understanding and reconciliation” with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen in colonial times. The first returns are planned for next year, she said.
A historian welcomed the plans, but said they don’t go far enough.
“Sadly, there is neither a precise time plan nor an unconditional commitment to restitute all looted artifacts,” said Juergen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg.
He also noted it’s not yet clear how many objects will be returned, or whether there will be any recognition of the efforts by civil society groups that had called for the restitution.
A British colonial expedition looted vast numbers of treasures from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, including numerous bas-reliefs and sculptures.
While hundreds of artifacts ended up in the British Museum, hundreds were also sold to other collections such as the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, which has one of the world’s largest collection of historical objects from the Kingdom of Benin, estimated to include about 530 items, including 440 bronzes.
The British Museum doesn’t currently have plans to return parts of its collection.
“The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged,” the British Museum said in a statement, adding that the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects is explained in gallery panels and on its website.
“We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest or peaceful exchange,” it said.
But Zimmerer, who has done extensive historical research on the Benin Bronzes, said the decision by Germany would likely affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle such artifacts.
“The pressure will grow, because the British position of simply not addressing the issue of restitution is no longer sustainable,” he said.

83,Four Dutch museums have 114 Benin City items in their ...,https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/03/four-dutch-museums-have-114-benin-city-items-in-their-collections/,"Dutch museums have at least 114 items stolen by British soldiers from the king’s palace in Benin City in 1897 in their collections, Trouw reported at the weekend.
The objects, known as the Benin Bronzes and including reliefs, statues and ivory artefacts, are now scattered around the world. Some are at the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, others are in private collections.
In the Netherlands, they are found in the Museum Volkenkunde in Leiden, the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, the Afrika Museum in Berg en Dal and Wereldmuseum in Rotterdam, Trouw said. The information comes from a report into the Benin Bronzes by the Wereldmuseum which is due to be published in the coming week.
Nigeria has been asking for the objects to be returned since independence in 1960 and the report gives sufficient grounds to talk about restitution, Henriette Lidchi, of the Museum van Wereldculturen, told the paper.
Stolen art
In October, the Dutch Council for Culture recommended that Dutch state museums returned stolen colonial art if requested, but it will be up to the next cabinet to decide how this should take place.
At the time, Stijn Schoonderwoerd, director of the National Museum of World Cultures, said he hoped the minister would accept the recommendation. Together the museums have some 270,000 objects in their collections.
In Britain, several regional museums have begun paving the way to return items which form part of the Benin Bronzes collection.
In January, Dutch magistrates fined five people from France and Belgium who took a statue from the Afrika Museum last year €250 each and sentenced them to suspended prison terms of one and two months.

84,The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes ... - Amazon.ca,https://www.amazon.ca/Brutish-Museums-Colonial-Violence-Restitution-ebook/dp/B08L5CLGSW,"The centre-piece, the prize exhibit of the book is the capture of the city of Benin by British forces in February 1897, and the subsequent looting of the celebrated Benin bronzes and their dispersal to museums and private collections. The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.",,2021-03-12,centre piece prize exhibit book capture city benin british force february 1897 subsequent loot celebrate benin bronze dispersal museum private collection attack benin

 The Brutish Museums: the Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution

 The book reconsiders the history of the sacking of Benin City in 1897, the meaning of the scattering of looted sacred and royal material culture to more than 160 museums around the world (including the Moesgaard Museum), and the changing debate over the permanent returning of African cultural heritage. The Brutish Museums is published on 5 November 2020.    
 Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen.    Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of brass plaques and carved ivory tusks depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections.    The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In  The Brutish Museums , Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism. The event includes a presentation of the book and a panel discussion with Temi Odumosu (Malmo University), Staffan Lundén (University of Gothenburg), and Michael Barrett (curator Africa section, National Museums of World Culture Sweden). The session is chaired by Vinnie Nørskov (Aarhus University).

89,Germany to return historical 'Benin Bronzes' looted in colonial ...,https://www.dailysabah.com/arts/germany-to-return-historical-benin-bronzes-looted-in-colonial-times/news,"Many Asian and African countries to this day are missing innumerable historical artifacts that were taken from their lands in colonial times that are now on display in western museums or adorn private collections. Germany is trying to rectify this by returning hundreds of historical items known as the Benin Bronzes that originate from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
The items in question were looted by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas welcomed a deal reached with museums and authorities in Nigeria to work on a restitution plan for a substantial number of artifacts, calling it a ""turning point in dealing with our colonial history.""
Germany's minister for culture, Monika Gruetters, said the Benin Bronzes were a key test for the way the country deals with its colonial past. ""We are confronting our historic and moral responsibility,"" she said.
Gruetters said the goal is to contribute to ""understanding and reconciliation"" with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen in colonial times. The first returns are planned for next year, she said.
A historian welcomed the plans, but said they do not go far enough. ""Sadly, there is neither a precise time plan nor an unconditional commitment to restitute all looted artifacts,"" said Juergen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg.
He also noted it is not yet clear how many objects will be returned, or whether there will be any recognition of the efforts by civil society groups that had called for the restitution.
A British colonial expedition looted vast numbers of treasures from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, including numerous bas-reliefs and sculptures.
While hundreds of artifacts ended up in the British Museum, hundreds were also sold to other collections such as the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, which has one of the world's largest collections of historical objects from the Kingdom of Benin, estimated to include about 530 items, including 440 bronzes.
The British Museum does not currently have plans to return parts of its collection. ""The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged,"" the British Museum said in a statement, adding that the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects is explained in gallery panels and on its website.
""We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest or peaceful exchange,"" it said.
But Zimmerer, who has done extensive historical research on the Benin Bronzes, said the decision by Germany would likely affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle such artifacts.
""The pressure will grow because the British position of simply not addressing the issue of restitution is no longer sustainable,"" he said.",,2021-04-30,many asian african country day miss innumerable historical artifact take land colonial time display western museum adorn private collection germany try rectify return hundred historical item know benin bronze originate west africa authority say friday item question loot british colonial expedition subsequently sell collection around world include german museum foreign minister heiko maas welcome deal reach museum authority nigeria work restitution plan substantial number artifact call turn point deal colonial history germany minister culture monika gruetters say benin bronze key test way country deal colonial past we confront historic moral responsibility say gruetters say goal contribute understand reconciliation descendant whose cultural treasure steal colonial time first return plan next year say historian welcome plan say far enough sadly neither precise time plan unconditional commitment restitute loot artifact say juergen zimmerer professor global history university hamburg also note yet clear many object return whether recognition effort civil society group call restitution british colonial expedition loot vast number treasure royal palace kingdom benin 1897 include numerous ba relief sculpture hundred artifact end british museum hundred also sell collection ethnological museum berlin one world large collection historical object kingdom benin estimate include 530 item include 440 bronze british museum currently plan return part collection the devastation plunder wreak upon benin city british military expedition 1897 fully acknowledge british museum say statement add circumstance around acquisition benin object explain gallery panel website we believe strength british museum collection resides breadth depth allow million visitor understand culture world interconnect time – whether trade migration conquest peaceful exchange say zimmerer do extensive historical research benin bronze say decision germany would likely affect wider debate institution former colonial country handle artifact the pressure grow british position simply address issue restitution longer sustainable say,mani asian african countri day miss innumer histor artifact taken land coloni time display western museum adorn privat collect germani tri rectifi return hundr histor item known benin bronz origin west africa author said friday item question loot british coloni expedit subsequ sold collect around world includ german museum foreign minist heiko maa welcom deal reach museum author nigeria work restitut plan substanti number artifact call turn point deal coloni histori germani minist cultur monika gruetter said benin bronz key test way countri deal coloni past we confront histor moral respons said gruetter said goal contribut understand reconcili descend whose cultur treasur stolen coloni time first return plan next year said historian welcom plan said far enough sadli neither precis time plan uncondit commit restitut loot artifact said juergen zimmer professor global histori univers hamburg also note yet clear mani object return whether recognit effort civil societi group call restitut british coloni expedit loot vast number treasur royal palac kingdom benin 1897 includ numer ba relief sculptur hundr artifact end british museum hundr also sold collect ethnolog museum berlin one world largest collect histor object kingdom benin estim includ 530 item includ 440 bronz british museum current plan return part collect the devast plunder wreak upon benin citi british militari expedit 1897 fulli acknowledg british museum said statement ad circumst around acquisit benin object explain galleri panel websit we believ strength british museum collect resid breadth depth allow million visitor understand cultur world interconnect time – whether trade migrat conquest peac exchang said zimmer done extens histor research benin bronz said decis germani would like affect wider debat institut former coloni countri handl artifact the pressur grow british posit simpli address issu restitut longer sustain said
90,Les « bronzes du Bénin » bientôt de retour au Nigeria – Jeune ...,https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1142563/culture/les-bronzes-du-benin-bientot-de-retour-au-nigeria/,"Alors qu’elle dévoile à Berlin, dans le tout nouveau Forum Humboldt, une bonne partie des objets « ethnologiques » qu’elle détient, l’Allemagne a annoncé discuter avec le Nigeria de la restitution des « bronzes du Bénin » issus du pillage d’Edo par l’armée britannique en 1897.
Le ministère allemand des Affaires étrangères a confirmé être « entré en discussion » avec les autorités nigérianes afin de procéder à la restitution des « bronzes du Bénin », une série de sculptures sur métal datant, pour la plupart, du XVIe siècle et dont les soldats britanniques se sont emparés en 1897, lors du pillage de Benin City, alors appelée Edo.
Selon le média spécialisé The Art Newspaper, le chef du département de la culture du ministère allemand s’est même rendu au Nigeria pendant la semaine du 15 mars afin de discuter avec le gouverneur de l’État d’Edo des modalités de la restitution. Un succès pour Abuja, qui demande à l’Allemagne le retour de ces œuvres depuis 1986, comme l’ambassadeur nigérian à Berlin l’a rappelé le 16 août 2019 dans un courrier adressé à la chancelière Angela Merkel.
530 « bronzes »
L’Allemagne possède 530 de ces fameux « bronzes », soit la deuxième plus importante collection au monde après celle du British Museum de Londres. Après le pillage d’Edo par les troupes britanniques – une expédition punitive organisée en réponse au meurtre d’une délégation de représentants de l’armée britannique à qui le souverain d’Edo avait interdit l’accès à son territoire –, les nombreux objets ramenés en Europe ont été échangés et revendus à de multiples reprises, pour finir par être disséminés jusqu’en Amérique du Nord.
Le débat sur le retour en Afrique des œuvres d’art et objets prélevés durant la période coloniale, provoqué par la parution, en France, du rapport Sarr-Savoy commandé par le président Emmanuel Macron, a été relancé dans tous les pays possédant de grands musées « ethnologiques » abritant de tels artefacts. En Allemagne, la polémique a pris une ampleur particulière du fait, à la fois, de l’histoire récente du pays et de l’ouverture annoncée d’une nouvelle institution culturelle, le Forum Humboldt.
Un coût exorbitant
Lancée en 2013, la construction de ce nouveau musée destiné à abriter 20 000 objets originaires d’Afrique, d’Asie ou d’Océanie et provenant en partie du Musée ethnologique et du Musée d’art asiatique de Berlin, a été critiquée pour son coût jugé exorbitant (677 millions d’euros, soit 100 millions de plus qu’annoncé) mais aussi pour le passé du site. L’ancien bâtiment fut rasé par les bombardements alliés à la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale puis reconstruit pour devenir le Palais de la République, siège du pouvoir de l’ex-RDA.
L’édifice avait également servi de résidence aux princes Hohenzollern, dont le nom reste associé à la brève – mais brutale – histoire coloniale du pays
L’édifice avait également servi de résidence aux princes Hohenzollern, dynastie qui a régné sur la Prusse et l’Allemagne jusqu’au début du XXe siècle et dont le nom reste associé à la brève – mais brutale – histoire coloniale du pays.
Du fait de la pandémie de Covid-19 et du confinement, l’inauguration du nouveau musée, en décembre 2020, a d’abord été virtuelle. Mais cela n’a pas empêché l’ambassadeur nigérian en Allemagne, Yusuf Tuggar, de saisir cette occasion pour demander à nouveau le retour des bronzes, dont 180 doivent être exposés au Forum Humboldt.
L’ouverture au public, elle, semble imminente. De son côté, le Nigeria prévoit d’accueillir les bronzes dans un nouveau musée qui doit être construit à Benin City et dont les plans ont été conçus par l’architecte star anglo-ghanéen David

91,The Haunting History of the Benin Bronzes - The Art Angle,https://artangle.libsyn.com/the-haunting-history-of-the-benin-bronzes,"Feb 25, 2021
For decades, one of the most urgent moral debates in the museum world has revolved around restitution, with art institutions around the world facing demands that masterworks in their collections be returned, either to countries like Greece and Italy who say that the treasures in question had been looted by tomb robbers, or to descendants of Jews who had been robbed by the Nazis. Today, the restitution question is as hotly debated as ever—what has changed, however, is that now the source countries that are demanding the returns are in Africa, and the looting at issue had been carried out by Britain and other European powers across the bloody years of colonialism, whose horrors remain obscured by the hagiographic official histories of the era.
Now, a new book is cutting through the Gordian knot of restitution with an argument of bracing moral clarity, showing the West’s great quote-unquote “universal” museums to be complicit in a history of ongoing atrocities. It’s called “The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence, and Cultural Restitution,” and it’s by Dan Hicks, professor of contemporary archeology at Oxford. As its title suggests, the book focuses on a particular incident of looting—the seizure of thousands of artworks from the Kingdom of Benin in 1897—and it is a history that should really be known around the world. To delve into the ongoing saga of the Benin Bronzes, Dan Hicks is on the show today for a two-part episode: first, to discuss the tragic story of the looting of the Kingdom and, second, the fate these magnificent objects are facing today.

92,Alarm over criminalisation of Benin Bronze protester – Art Law ...,https://artlawandmore.com/2020/09/29/alarm-over-criminalisation-of-benin-bronze-protester/,"Restitution campaigners have expressed alarm over the conviction of a man who staged a protest at the Museum of London in January 2020.
33-year-old Isaiah Ogundele took part in a demonstration at the Museum’s permanent ‘London, Sugar & Slavery’ gallery on 29 January 2020. The gallery explores London’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and contains two original Benin bronzes on long-term loan from the British Museum: a water container (1500s) and a brass plaque (1500s-1600s).
The ‘Benin Bronzes’ in the British Museum’s collection are a group of sculptures created from at least the 16th century onwards in the West African Kingdom of Benin by specialist guilds working for the royal court of the Oba (king) in Benin City. In 1897, British troops invaded Benin City and plundered the royal palace and other ceremonial sites. No systematic record was made of the looted objects, which were then distributed and sold across the world.
Ogundele protested at the Museum of London to call for the restitution of the Benin Bronzes to their country of origin. According to a spokeswoman for the Museum of London, Ogundele “became increasingly concerned about the objects on display”. He is reported to have knocked over several sculptures from their plinths in a bid to seize them and shouted at members of Museum of London staff. Police were called and Ogundele was arrested.
On 18 September, Stratford Magistrates’ Court convicted him in absentia after Ogundele failed to appear at court. According to The Art Newspaper, Ogundele, who has no fixed abode, may have been unaware of the date for the court hearing. He was found guilty of “threatening/abusive/insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm, or distress”. The offence may require Ogundele to serve a prison sentence of up to six months, a fine or both.
The incident marks the first time a UK museum has been involved in the criminalisation of a protest about the repatriation of African cultural heritage.
Campaigners for the restitution of stolen African artefacts and human remains in UK museums and cultural institutions reacted strongly to Ogundele’s arrest and conviction. Executive director of AFFORD (African Foundation for Development), Onyekachi Wambu, who attended the 18 September hearing, said “Judging by the evidence given in court, what the young man needed was additional support to help with his welfare, not criminalisation”.
“Attempts to criminalise those participating in these campaigns should be avoided at all costs, not least when we consider the initial violent and murderous circumstances in which these collections were acquired. Criminalising the descendants of those original victims intensifies the original crimes”, Wambu added.
Director of arts and education charity Culture&, Errol Francis, expressed similar concerns. “While I would not support the damage of artefacts, I am concerned about what appears to be a criminalisation of protest in this case”, Francis said.

93,Interviews: Finally we get to see the Benin Bronzes in Benin ...,https://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/interviews-finally-we-get-to-see-the-benin-bronzes-in-benin-city~b7b59c2c/,"Interviews: Finally we get to see the Benin Bronzes in Benin City
Authorities from Europe and Nigeria have agreed to build a new exhibition space in Benin City to host the Benin Bronzes, that were stolen in 1897 from the royal palace. European museums will lend some of the objects in their collections to the Royal Benin Museum, which should be finished in 2021. What do Nigerians directly connected to the Bronzes think about this?
PAYING THEM TO SEE WHAT WE MADE - THAT FEELS TERRIBLE
Phil Omodamwen (1971), bronze founder
“You are born a bronze founder. The oven is on the family yard, as a child you see how everything works. But women are not allowed to learn it, because if they marry, knowledge would end up outside the family. Only eleven families still belong to the bronze foundry guild, established by Oba Oguola at the end of the 13th century. If people who do not belong to the guild still cast bronze, then we have a few tough men who take everything from them.
We only cast bronze heads and reliefs for the Oba, others were not allowed to own them. It was the guild’s task to record the history, battles and important events in bronze. A few years ago I cast a relief based on a painful historical photograph from 1897. The British had just robbed the palace and banned Oba Ovonramwen. The photo shows Oba Ovonramwen on the British yacht that takes him to exile in Calabar. That is also our history, you can’t change that, that’s why I made that relief. A copy of it has been exhibited at the Ethnological Museum in Stockholm.
I’m afraid I’m the last generation of bronze founders. My sons find the work too heavy, and you don’t make much money with it. This set of two leopards in my studio takes six to eight weeks of work, and costs around $ 1500. I almost exclusively sell to expats: Americans, Germans, through a gallery in Lagos. We used to just go to those oil companies and sell our bronzes. But now it’s too unsafe there; robberies and abductions are frequent, also in the area where we buy beeswax.
Some fifty people used to work for me, now only twenty. Many have left for Europe. Three members of our family died en route.
People from the British Museum came here at the end of last year. They asked me if I wanted to make a relief. It was a tempting offer, but no thanks. I don’t want African refugees to link my name to their misery.
In 1990, I was at the British Museum. It felt terrible to have to pay to see the images we made. I don’t even have the money to buy a catalog.
I am very sad about this arrangement, in which European museums lend to us what we have been forcibly robbed of. But if the objects ever come back, let them give them to the Oba, not to the federal government bodies, because they would just resell those objects.”
THESE RELIGIOUS OBJECTS NOW HAVE A NEW, CULTURAL MEANING
Prince Gregory Akenzua (1938), Professor of Pediatrics, Prince, brother of the previous Oba (king), Enogie (duke), delegate of the Royal Court in the Benin Dialogue Group
“As an Enogie, I represent the Oba in a region outside the city. People often prefer to go to me rather than go to court. Traditional law revolves around mediation between communities, often about land. The land law (1978) included all the Oba’s the land.
I also represent the Oba in the negotiations with European museums about the Benin Bronzes. Some people here see the loan agreement and a new museum in Benin City as a sign that we have not fought hard enough. But we do not give up our claim to ownership. I see this agreement as a step towards return. As far as we are concerned, they can exhibit copies in Europe; we would happily abandon copyrights.
Right, originally the objects had a religious meaning, they were not intended to be in a museum. But the current Oba, His Majesty Ewuare II, recognizes the objects have taken on a new cultural meaning, that is best preserved in a museum. That is why he is participating in building a museum for it.
Previous Obas have done it before, they donated objects to museums in Lagos and Benin. This Oba has studied in the UK and the US, he was ambassador in Scandinavia and Italy. He is now using his previous experiences and training to improve our culture.”
GIVE THEM BACK, WITHOUT CLAUSES
Victor Ehikhamenor (1970) Visual artist, photographer, columnist
“I was born in a catholic hospital, was baptized catholic and went to a catholic school. But traditional altars were everywhere. My grandfather was still religious in a traditional way. He prayed to his ancestors at the house altar and had six wives - all grandmothers who told me the stories I grew up with.
As a toddler I was already obsessed with drawing. Only later did I realize that praying to saints does not differ substantially from praying to the spirits of ancestors, as my grandfather did. When I studied computer science in the UK and the US, I became aware of my artistic roots: my uncle was a photographer, I drew ‘photos’ of my friends. And I drew the altar images and the symbolic religious signs that I saw all around me. I still use these in my paintings and sculptures.
The items that have been stolen from us must be returned, without clauses. If the art that the Nazis robbed of Jews must be returned to the entitled heirs, the Bronzes must be returned to the present Oba, Ewuare II. He is the heir to Oba Ovonramwen, from whose palace the British stole the artefacts in 1897.
Whether the palace is accessible to everyone, whether everyone can see the objects there? That question betrays your western perspective! Those objects were intended not to be seen by everyone. Should every American have access to the White House? They were never meant for aesthetics, ‘art for art’s sake’, that’s not how we Africans look at it.
Moreover: the Oba, Edo state, and the federal government are now working together to build a museum. They see the loan agreement as a step towards return, I know that. But my personal opinion is: we should never agree with that borrowing. Europeans continue to insult us with this. So we can borrow our own stuff and then send it back to the British Museum!? And those questions like ‘what will they do with it if we return the objects?’ - it’s all a repetition of the mistreatment of my people.”
THE WEST HAS TAKEN GOOD CARE OF THEM
Ekhagousa Aisien (1939), surgeon, chronicler of orally transmitted stories about the Benin Kingdom
“Four centuries ago, you Dutch were our best trading partners. The pope had forbidden arms sales to pagans, and that is why the Portuguese only brought us beads and such. They were greatly appreciated at the court, but you sold us pistols. And metals, with which we have copied those pistols by the thousands. This enabled Benin to expand its empire.
I have written eight history books about Benin. They are mostly based on the stories my father heard in the palace. He was the educator of Oba Eweka II (king from 1914 to 1933), designated to do so by an oracle.
Already my grandfather, a village chief, had contacts at the royal court, thanks to his reputation as a warrior. Once he sent his servant to buy palm wine. But Itsekiri, a neighboring people, imprisoned the man and offered him to their God of War. No, the Benin people were not the only ones who did that. When later Itsekiri sailed past the river, my grandfather had them overpowered. He crucified seven, and left them on the bank for fear. The others he donated as slaves to the Oba. In the war that broke out, he smashed a banana tree with one blow of his sword and an enemy hiding behind it in half.
In 1897, when the British advanced to Benin, the king sent him out as a scout. From the forest, he fired a shot at a British officer who was having tea. I also found that incident described in a diary of a British army medic with the troops. My grandfather was later punished with sixty lashes.
The British crushed us. They had their Maxim machine guns firing thirteen bullets per second. Our guns had to be reloaded after every shot.
It’s wonderful that European museums will lend objects to a new museum here. Return? Oh well, it was spoils of war, that’s how it went then. It was an unjust war, but what war is just?
One of the good things that came out of it that the Benin Bronzes created a more sophisticated image of Africa in Europe, at least among art connoisseurs. They showed that Africans could be artistic.
Had the British not taken those objects, we might have sold them here and there. Fortunately, it has been well looked after. That is why we will still be able to see them. At present we still lack pride and appreciation for those artefacts. But hopefully that will grow, and we can take care of it ourselves in the long term.”
BURN THESE ALTARS
Kate Osakue (1972), evangelist
“I took all my house altars in 2007, on which I prayed to the ancestors and gods, to a church and burned them. First I combined traditional with Christian belief. But me and my family didn’t do well. My children didn’t listen to me. In church I sometimes got into a trance, then I had visions that I was holding the Bible and telling others about it. A minister told me that I had a calling by God.
Then I started a church myself. I have redeemed more than twenty people. Now I call churchgoers to burn their altars. Last time we did it in my church was only a week ago. Yes, it must happen in the house of God: newcomers who are still under the influence of priests will see that nothing happens when you do so. First we pray together for a week, then we bring the altars into the church, pour them on with blessed oil, and burn them with gasoline. The altars still contain supernatural power - from rivers, seas and forests. As we read in the Bible, Ephesians 6:12: “ For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.”
Yes, I know that the British stole many objects from the Oba palace altars in 1897. I think they have to return - not to worship them, but they are part of our civilization. I myself would not go to that new museum. What would I have to look for?”
I REALLY LIKED THESE BEAUTIFUL BEADS
Ebosetale Divine Comfort Idiogbe (2010)
“There will be a new museum? I didn’t know. I went to the Benin National Museum yesterday. Look, I’ve written down everything I’ve seen there, so I can remember it better.
What has impressed me the most is the ogluwu, a wooden statue of the God of Death. The Oba had his servants bring one to somebody on death row. Whoever received the object knew he would be killed. I really liked the beautiful clothes of the Queen Mother, with beads, and a high crown. The king and the queen mother kept their jewels in a box in the shape of a fish.
There was also an image of a woman with very many breasts, because she had many children to feed. They were all around her.
I also saw palace guards on bronze reliefs, and a warrior chief who loved fighting. I think we still have a warrior chief, but I’m not sure.
I didn’t know that the British took all those things. My father told me that we have seen a feature film about the British invasion of 1897, but I don’t remember it. We haven’t talked about it at school yet. I will definitely visit the new museum and see what came back.”
YOUR BABY WILL TURN INTO BRONZE, THEY SAID
Princess Elizabeth Olowu (1937), daughter of Oba Akenzua II (king from 1933 - 1978). Artist, bronze founder
“My father, Oba Akenzua II, was a very fatherly person. He came to the harem every afternoon at around four. ‘Kau!’ he cried, ‘I’m coming’. Then he wanted to see all his children, so around that time we all had to be in the harem.
I still remember all the songs. Once, when I was very young, my father got dressed for the annual Igue festival. His chiefs spent three hours on his tunic, hung with coral beads. His women sang: “The Oba is getting ready to go outside, he is dressing like a warrior, as if he is getting ready for battle.” When he entered the harem, the women sang: “You are more beautiful than the most beautiful woman.”
I thought: is my father a woman?
All the women followed him in procession: number eight, ten, twelve, depending on their position. A woman having her period could not come along. She was seen as unclean and had to stay in a separate building.
That is one of the reasons why the bronze foundry guild does not tolerate women in the melting furnaces. If they menstruate, they would contaminate the oven and cause accidents. You don’t joke with molten bronze.
When they heard that I was casting bronze, they said: “If you become pregnant, your baby in your lap will turn into bronze. You will die when giving birth.”
First I was a painter. As a child I already scratched motifs in the skin of gourds that I saw in the palace. My father often took me to the ancestral altar when he made sacrifices. I saw him perform all rituals, pray, and ring the bell.
Once I picked up the bell. “Put it down!” my father roared. I was shocked! He later explained: “If you ring that bell, you call on the spirits of the ancestors.”
I thought: when I grow up, I want to make a bell like that.
Opposite my school was a blacksmith - not a bronze founder, that is another guild. He was an old man. I brought him kola nuts and tobacco, and watched how he made fire and melted metal into round balls, just like gold.
“What are those balls?” I asked him.
“Bullets,” he said. “To hunt antelopes.”
He allowed me to watch. I learned.
“I love that work,” I said, “I want to cast bronze later.”
He said: “What!? Leave that out of your mind! The bronze founders will never allow you, as a woman. They will beat you up.”
He didn’t know who I was. I said: “What if the Oba gives me permission?”
He said, “If you want to be killed, do as you like.”
One of the first things I cast was a bell. I gave it to my father.”
A WELL DOCUMENTED CRIME
Benson Osadolor, Professor of History at the University of Benin City. Specialist on military history of Benin kingdom
“The Portuguese reached Benin in 1472, and from 1485 the first Portuguese reports on the situation here appeared. This was followed by reports from Dutch, British and Italian traders and missionaries. These are important primary sources, in addition to oral lore by members of the still existing guilds and palace organizations.
The looting of the Bronzes has been a piece of colonial injustice. The crime has been extensively documented and photographed. Colonial authorities wrote to London that they would finance the war with loot, especially ivory. They knew they had to set up an international force to beat Benin; had they been defeated it would have meant a loss of ground to the French or Germans, competitors in the strategic areas around the Niger Delta.
The objects have been stolen and must be returned, immediately and permanently – no loans. For Africans, and especially Nigerians, there are high barriers to getting visas, how can they ever see their stolen things in the US? Let the Americans come to us if they want to see the Bronzes.
Yes, I would definitely like the job of curator at the new Royal Benin Museum. First of all, I would ensure that no objects disappear, as has often happened in Nigerian museums. I recently visited the existing Benin National Museum, and I was disappointed how little was left of what I saw there in my youth. I am confident that the new museum will be well protected with cameras and such.
In the West, museums market their exhibitions: they organize lectures, they have the means to teach children something about their history and heritage. You don’t have that here, and that’s why exhibitions attract so few visitors.
With those objects I would tell the history of the society in which they originated - yes, also about things like human sacrifices and slaves. The neighboring peoples, such as Igbos and Yorubas, still see the Bini as bad people. They suffered from the fact that Bini caught and killed them or traded them as slaves.
The Bini needed blood for their altars, for which they sacrificed slaves, not their own people.
In Washington, the National Museum of the American Indian also shows the genocide of Indians. To dwell on the injustice that has been done to others, to strive for reconciliation by showing that you regret it: we should do the same in that museum.”
YOU CANNOT FIX CULTURE
Sam Igbe (1929), Iyase (‘prime minister’) to the Oba
“Already in 1958 I saw the Bronzes in the British Museum. Then the British were still in charge. The call for restitution was not yet heard that much; it only became stronger after the independence of 1960.
The Bronzes were made for the Obas, for the palace, and not for a museum. But the Oba also thinks it is important that they come to a museum and that everyone can see what we were able to make then; that we can be proud of it.
No, I am not afraid that our traditional culture will disappear. We cannot fix our culture, it is developing. I’m an Anglican myself, but at home I also have an ancestor altar, no problem. I once heard a minister say in church that who, like me, holds a traditional position will not go to heaven. I told him: “You and I don’t know who goes to heaven and who goes to hell. God decides that. “
I also asked the bishop if I could explain on the pulpit what I was doing here at the palace. But he told me not to worry and that the preacher was stupid. I left it at that.
I honestly did not know that those objects would be on loan in the new museum. I don’t think that’s a good decision. Those objects are our property. They were stolen.”
HAVE WE TAKEN CARE OF OUR HERITAGE OURSELVES?
Prince Yemisi Adedoyin Shyllon, art collector, opens his own museum in Lagos in October
“I come from an industrial family working in the oil. I have been drawing myself since I was young and studied art books in the school library. Working for a company importing agricultural vehicles I traveled a lot, also outside of Nigeria. I bought traditional art everywhere, often altar pieces.
Christian evangelists have brainwashed people en masse. There are said to be ‘demons’ in museums. Even museum staff often see traditional objects as ‘fetish’, something ‘devilish’, because they are Christians or Muslims. They put government money in their own pocket. Museums are collapsing, they are yielding nothing to politicians.
I own a pair of bronzes. For a long time the West denied that we Africans had a history. The bronzes are the hallmarks, the benchmarks of our history. That is why we need the originals. I think Western museums have to pay for showing the bronzes, also in recognition that they are our property.”
A BUS TICKET, INSTEAD OF AN AIRLINE TICKET
Theophilus Umogbai (1966), curator of the National Museum in Benin City, delegation member of the Benin Dialogue Group
“Yes, there will be a new museum of the state of Edo and the Oba, next to this museum I am the curator of, and which is owned by the federal state. But I am not afraid that my museum will become superfluous. Both museums tell a different story. The new museum will display antique works from the palace, court art, which European museums lend to us from their collection. Whereas my museum focuses on the culture of the rest of society.
I am often asked if the items in my museum are authentic, and then they mean from before 1897. Then I answer: how should that be possible if the British robbed almost everything? Most of the objects here, about two thousand in total, are from after 1897. In that year, the British had banned the sitting Oba. So the palace was empty when they allowed his son to become an Oba again in 1913. So he ordered new objects from the various guilds - wood carvers, ivory carvers, bronze casters. The altars filled again under the successive Obas, and in 1947 the palace needed a repository.
This museum was made from that repository in 1973. Altar objects that people have donated are also on show here. Until the 1970s, most residents had an altar at home. But many have been discarded, especially under the influence of evangelical Christians.
No, those stories that many objects have disappeared from this museum are incorrect. If people have seen items in our collection and then miss them, they assume they have been stolen and spread conspiracy theories. Objects from this museum have been lent to other museums in Nigeria, via the central museum authority NCMM in Lagos. And then they stay somewhere. From 2001 to 2012 I was a curator at the National Museum in Owo. I needed four Benin objects from this museum for an exhibition. Guess where they are now? Still in Owo!
A museum with borrowed objects from Europe is of course not the ultimate goal. But giving back is a matter between governments. In the Benin Dialogue only curators have spoken about the new museum. A curator cannot bag some objects from his museum and send them to Nigeria. But we can exchange, we can arrange that as trustees, it happens more often.
Finally we shall get to see the objects that we have been missing since 1897 - for the price of a bus ticket, instead of an airline ticket.”",,2019-07-19,interview finally get see benin bronze benin

By Eilís Doolan
After several months of coronavirus closures, museums around the world have reopened to a changed and unfamiliar world. Aside from new regulations about sanitizing, social distancing, and contact tracing, institutions are facing another, much more critical threat to their futures – that of decolonisation through restitution.
The powerful resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in the past eight months has not left museums unscathed. Indeed, it has given new weight to the call for Western museums to address their links to slavery and colonialism. The British Museum is one institution which has faced particular criticism, starting with its response to the death of George Floyd. Alongside many other institutions, the British Museum attempted to express support for BML in June, when director Hartwig Fischer tweeted that the museum is “aligned with the spirit and soul of Black Lives Matter everywhere.” Mr. Fischer’s tweet was met with immediate mockery online. Author Stephanie Yeboah responded: “Did our lives matter when you STOLE ALL OUR THINGS?” “If we matter that much to you, give it back.”
The critical response to Mr. Fischer’s tweet is understandable – it is difficult to reconcile his statement, deemed “knee-jerk” by many, with the museum’s record on restitution. Indeed, his statement seems to have done more harm than good, only drawing further attention to the museum’s failure in this area.
Founded in 1753, the British Museum is the world’s largest global history museum, possessing over eight million artefacts from around the world, including some 73’000 objects from sub-Saharan Africa. However, the museum’s ownership of many of these objects has been scrutinised, and they are facing accusations that they were not legitimately obtained but stolen from their rightful owners.
Among the most contentious items in the museum are the Benin Bronzes, which embody the results of extractive colonialism. Originally produced by the kingdom to depict the history of the Royal Court of Benin City, thousands of objects from their collection were looted in 1879, when British military forces invaded Benin on a ‘Punitive Expedition.’ These treasures ended up in museums and private collections around the world- about 800 of them ended up in the British Museum. For years, the museum has faced calls for the bronzes to be returned to Africa. Indeed, in 2000, the Benin royal family requested the property to be restored to them. Yet, the British Museum has yet to return a single object. The museum has expressed willingness to loan some items to Nigeria – but it refuses to return them permanently.
To say that the British Museum has done nothing to decolonise itself would be misleading. Since reopening, it has introduced two main changes. Firstly, the museum moved a bust of its founder, Hans Sloane, to be displayed in a case alongside objects related to the British involvement in the slave trade, where he is clearly labelled as a “slave owner.” The second change consists of the museum’s creation of a new guided route named “Collecting and Empire,” which aims to explain how items made their way into the museum—though it emphasises that most objects were bought or donated, not stolen.
The museum’s efforts are fundamentally undermined by their reluctance to take action regarding the Benin Bronzes. According to Chika Okeke-Agulu, professor of African and African Diaspora art at Princeton university, the museum must commit itself to the necessary project of cultural reconstitution, if it truly wants to decolonise. He posits: “the British Museum still behaves like a colonial museum. You cannot claim to be an encyclopaedic collector of stolen objects.”
Returning African objects to their legitimate owners is not only a long-overdue chance for cultural institutions to atone for crimes committed under colonialism—it is a chance to listen to black voices, and to allow Africans to control their own heritage. Currently, an estimated 90 to 95 percent of all African heritage is held in museums outside the African continent. As a result, most Nigerians will never have a chance to see the Benin Bronzes, a crucial part of their collective historical identity, in their home country. The opportunity to see one’s own heritage becomes reserved for those privileged enough to afford international travel. Tandazani Dhaklama, assistant curator at Zeitz MOCAA in Cape Town, argues that Africans “deserve the right to engage with and see themselves in their own culture, their own heritage on African soil.” Dan Hicks, restitution scholar and curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum, further argues that restitution has the power to undo structures of whiteness that museums have historically enforced. The economic impact of restitution, too, cannot be understated. Europe’s institutions generate around 509 billion euros each year – a benefit from which African nations have been excluded. In this sense, Onyekachi Wambu, the executive director of the African Foundation for Development, finds that restitution can be a step “towards constructing a more just future.”
The long and ongoing fight for restitution has seen some successes, although they have been few and far between. In 2014, a grandson of a British soldier on the ‘Punitive Expedition’ returned two inherited items to the Benin Royal family. In 2018, the Museum of Black Civilisations (MCN) opened in Senegal, which documents the diverse history of the black world and calls for all stolen African objects to be returned. So far, the MCN has only received one item back, namely the sword of Omar Saidou Tall, which was returned by the French government in 2019 as part of a French project to return 26 artefacts to Benin. In response to George Floyd’s death, arts charity Culture& has announced the publication of a new BLM charter, intended to hold the heritage sector accountable and to encourage the decolonising of collections. According to Errol Francis, Culture& CEO, “the moral case has now become overwhelming. It’s unstoppable.” So far, only the Wellcome Collection and the Museums Association have made contact with Culture&.
Two weeks ago, five activists faced trial on theft charges for trying to remove a nineteenth century African funeral staff from the Quai Branly Museum in Paris this June. Congo-born activist Emery Mwazulu Diyabanza streamed the entire act on Facebook Live, parading it around the building and telling viewers: “We’re taking it home.” The men argued that the removal of the Chadian object, which was quickly stopped by guards, was an act of protest against colonial pillaging. The protesters were charged with attempted group theft of a historical object, facing up to ten years in prison and 150’000 euros in fines. In the courtroom, Diyabanza defended himself: “appropriation wasn’t my goal... The aim was to mark the symbolism of the liberation of these works.” The Parisian court reached a verdict today, fining Diyabanza 2’000 euros.
While the debate around restitution shows no signs of slowing down, it still remains to be seen whether museums will stand behind their knee-jerk reactions to the Black Lives Matter Movement. Alongside the scrutinising of diversity among staff and exhibited artists, the project of restitution is a crucial part of the heritage sector’s obligation to address the outstanding debt of colonialism. “It’s a test for us as a sector to see how resilient we are,” Hicks concludes, “how willing we are to change so that we aren’t hurting people by allowing displays that are racist or hurtful in any other way to exist.”

Germany's decision could affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle looted artifacts, one expert says
Germany is returning hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes that were mostly looted from West Africa by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums, authorities said Friday.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas welcomed a deal reached with museums and authorities in Nigeria to work on a restitution plan for a substantial number of artifacts, calling it a “turning point in dealing with our colonial history.”
Germany’s minister for culture, Monika Gruetters, said the Benin Bronzes were a key test for the way the country deals with its colonial past.
“We are confronting our historic and moral responsibility,” she said.
Gruetters said the goal is to contribute to “understanding and reconciliation” with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen in colonial times. The first returns are planned for next year, she said.
A historian welcomed the plans, but said they don’t go far enough.
“Sadly, there is neither a precise time plan nor an unconditional commitment to restitute all looted artifacts,” said Juergen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg.

He also noted it’s not yet clear how many objects will be returned, or whether there will be any recognition of the efforts by civil society groups that had called for the restitution.
A British colonial expedition looted vast numbers of treasures from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, including numerous bas-reliefs and sculptures.
While hundreds of artifacts ended up in the British Museum, hundreds were also sold to other collections such as the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, which has one of the world’s largest collection of historical objects from the Kingdom of Benin, estimated to include about 530 items, including 440 bronzes.
The British Museum doesn’t currently have plans to return parts of its collection.

“The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged,” the British Museum said in a statement, adding that the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects is explained in gallery panels and on its website.
“We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest or peaceful exchange,” it said.
But Zimmerer, who has done extensive historical research on the Benin Bronzes, said the decision by Germany would likely affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle such artifacts.
“The pressure will grow, because the British position of simply not addressing the issue of restitution is no longer sustainable,” he said.

The Benin bronzes have become a touchstone to test Europe’s commitment to returning African heritage plundered in the colonial era. While Germany is leading the way, the United Kingdom is still dragging its heels.
Current issue
Can Germany persuade the United Kingdom to redress the crimes of its past? It seems an odd role reversal, but that is the course that events are taking in the debate over the Benin bronzes.
Thousands of these exquisitely crafted sculptures—made of ivory and brass as well as bronze—were looted by British troops in a bloody 1897 raid on the Royal Palace in the kingdom of Benin, in modern-day Nigeria. They are now scattered in museums across the Western world. Some are 500 years old. They tell the story of an enduring and powerful civilization.
The Benin bronzes have become a touchstone to test Europe’s commitment to decolonizing museums and restituting African heritage plundered in the colonial era. Germany is carving a path for the return of the sculptures in its museums to Nigeria that other European institutions seem bound to follow. Some may do so readily and soon; others—most notably the British Museum, which holds around 900 Benin treasures, the largest contingent—are still resisting, and may only return them after much pressure, foot dragging, and an array of delaying tactics.
As the Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe sees it: “There is simply no moral ground for the confiscation of African artefacts in Western museums. It will take the time it will take, but the movement is unstoppable.”
A simmering decades-old debate over the return of colonial-era acquisitions in European museums burst to the surface in 2017, when French President Emmanuel Macron, in a speech in Burkina Faso, pledged to permanently return African heritage in France to Africa.
Since then, a number of countries have taken concrete steps. In 2019, Germany’s 16 federal states approved guidelines creating the conditions for the repatriation of artefacts in public collections taken “in ways that are legally or morally unjustifiable today” from former colonies. Germany has also established a central help desk (Kontaktstelle) to provide information about colonial-era heritage and has committed funding for museums to conduct provenance research.
UK Drags its Heels
In January, the Dutch government became the first in Europe to approve a central mechanism for repatriating stolen cultural heritage and pledged to return, unconditionally, any objects in the national collections looted from Dutch colonies. France last year passed a law allowing the restitution of 27 looted artefacts to former colonies.
Meanwhile, however, progress in the UK has been halting. The Arts Council England has delayed delivering guidelines for museums on handling colonial-era plunder that were initially due to be published last autumn.
Across Europe—including in Germany and the UK—the repatriation of human remains to their communities of origin has become routine museum business. Some artefacts have been restituted to former colonies. But the now very real prospect of a return to Nigeria of the Benin bronzes held in German museums is a turning point in the process.
The bronzes have an emblematic value, in part because of the brutal circumstances of their loss, but also because they are among the most important African artworks in European museums. They include elaborate cast plaques, commemorative heads of leaders, animal and human figures, items of royal regalia, and personal ornaments. They were produced from the 16th century onwards by guilds working for the royal court of the oba, or king.
Many had a ritual significance in honoring ancestors. Perhaps the most cherished of these precious artefacts are the plaques which once decorated the Benin Royal Palace and provide an important historical record of the kingdom. “The looting was like a book being torn to pieces and then the pages were put in different places,” says Kokunre Eghafona, a professor of cultural anthropology at the University of Benin.
A Decades-long Debate
In a “punitive expedition” against the kingdom of Benin in 1897, British troops ransacked the oba’s palace and looted its treasures, which were then sold to museums across Europe and America. Dan Hicks, a curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and the author of a recently published book about the Benin bronzes called “The Brutish Museums,” estimates that there are more than 10,000 items strewn across more than 160 museums worldwide and countless private collections.
While Macron’s initiative added new impetus to the debate on colonial-era heritage in European museums, the discussion about the Benin bronzes has rumbled on for decades. The Benin Dialogue Group, founded in 2007, organized regular meetings between the Nigerian stakeholders and the curators at museums with substantial holdings of Benin bronzes, including the Berlin Ethnological Museum, the Museum am Rothenbaum in Hamburg, the British Museum, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and Dutch and Swedish National Museums of World Cultures, and Vienna’s Weltmuseum.
The group agreed to loan Benin bronzes to Nigeria on a rotating loan basis. It also spawned Digital Benin, a project to reunite the royal art at least in the virtual world. But perhaps most importantly, it lent encouragement to the Nigerian partners—the Edo State government, the royal court of Benin, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments—which have set up the Legacy Restoration Trust to manage negotiations with the Western holders of looted treasures and to oversee construction of a new museum complex designed by David Adjaye, to be located next to the oba’s palace in Benin.
In March, Andreas Görgen, the head of the German Foreign Ministry’s culture department, visited Benin City for discussions with Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and other Nigerian officials. Under the terms of an agreement that Görgen expects will be finalized by the summer, Germany would take part in archaeological excavations, provide training for Nigerian museum employees, participate in the construction of the new museum, and restitute looted Benin sculptures and reliefs in German museum collections.
A Question of Justice
For German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, “the question of returning cultural heritage is part of an honest approach to colonial history. It’s a question of justice.” Around 25 German museums are known to possess items looted by British troops in the sacking of the royal palace in the kingdom of Benin in 1897. Those most affected are Berlin’s Ethnological Museum (soon to open in the Humboldt Forum), Dresden’s Museum für Völkerkunde, the Grassi Museum in Leipzig, Cologne’s Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, the Linden Museum in Stuttgart, and Hamburg’s Museum am Rothenbaum.
In April, German Culture Minister Monika Grütters, museum directors and state culture ministers met to define a “national strategy” on the Benin bronzes in German museum collections and develop a timetable for their restitution, with the aim of returning the first objects in 2022.
The Guardian was quick to point out that Germany’s commitment to return the bronzes “piles pressure” on the British Museum. More pressure was “piled” (according to The Telegraph and The Times) when the University of Aberdeen said it will return a sculpture of an oba’s head to Nigeria because it was “acquired in a way that we now consider to have been extremely immoral” and described the Benin looting as “one of the most notorious examples of the pillaging of cultural treasures associated with 19th-century European colonial expansion.”
But the British Museum (whose director, incidentally, is the German art historian Hartwig Fischer) is practiced at deflecting that kind of pressure. “The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged by the museum and the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects explained in gallery panels and on the museum’s website,” it said in a statement. As though that should be enough to satisfy any potential claimant for looted art.
Berlin’s Ethnological Museum has the second-largest collection of Benin bronzes in Europe. Jonathan Fine, the head curator, says it possesses about 440 looted objects. “Precisely because this issue is so pressing it’s important for museums to engage with it, and not just at the level of rhetoric or moving a couple of labels around,” he says.
Fine is curating an exhibition of the Benin bronzes for the newly opened Humboldt Forum that will open in 2022. Given the current discussions with Nigeria, it’s not clear now what their status will be by the time of the exhibition. Hermann Parzinger, the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation which oversees Berlin’s museums, wrote in an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on March 27 that the museum plans to show about half, which “by no means excludes later returns of the objects to be shown.”
Colonial “Blind Spot”
One room of the two-room exhibition, Fine says, “focuses on the invasion, the violence, what the plunder looked like and how after the plunder, works of art, ritual objects, and everyday objects were scattered throughout the world.” A centerpiece of the show will be “interviews with stakeholders from Nigeria and from European institutions talking about what the Benin bronzes are, what their loss has meant and what should happen to them in the future,” he added.
British museums will be watching this German confrontation with unappetizing aspects of Britain’s past with interest. Some might question why Berlin is choosing to address British colonial history in one of its first shows in the newly reconstructed Prussian royal palace in the heart of the capital instead of, say, German looting in Tanzania or Namibia. But the symbolic value of the Benin bronzes—as well as their quantity and quality—is hard to beat.
Grütters has described the colonial past as a “blind spot” in Germany’s culture of remembrance. That blind spot persists in the UK—what Hicks describes as a “Queen Victoria-sized hole in our historical consciousness in terms of our role internationally.” But he views Europe as a whole at the beginning of “a new reckoning with the incredibly violent later phases of empire”—including the UK, even if the message hasn’t got through to all the museums—or the government.
The most prominent cultural policy of the current UK government has been to protect statues of slave traders from Black Lives Matter protesters. Leaders resist discussion about restituting museum treasures—or sidetrack the debate by focusing on the Parthenon Marbles in the British Museum. These were removed from Greece in a very different context and should be addressed separately from the Benin bronzes. The marbles were not seized by military force in a brutal attack against a culture and people.
Nazi-looted Art
Unlike the UK, Germany has many decades of experience in confronting its past atrocities. It is often observed that the word Vergangenheitsbewältigung (coming to terms with the past) has no equivalent in English. But nor does the more proactive (and perhaps slightly more pronounceable for non-native-speakers) word Aufarbeitung, which encompasses everything from remembering, researching, and documenting the crimes of the past to educating the next generation about them. Restitution is a part of that work.
German museums have handed back thousands of artworks looted by the Nazis to the heirs of Jewish collectors. But the initiative for international principles on returning Nazi-looted art in public collections did not come from Germany—the momentum behind the 1998 Washington Principles on Nazi-looted art came from the United State, where many of the families most affected by Nazi plunder now live.
And in the case of colonial-era plunder, it should be the communities of origin that call the shots. These are not only in Africa—much of Dutch museums’ decolonization effort, for example, is focused on Indonesia—but Africa has a central role to play. In Addis Ababa in February, African Union leaders made culture and heritage their key theme for this year, with workshops planned on the restitution of stolen cultural heritage.
Across the continent, activists are gearing up campaigns, and museums are heeding the call. The Nairobi National Museum is currently showing an exhibition featuring research into Kenyan objects held in museums around the world, called Invisible Inventories. The research project, funded by the Goethe Institute and the Kulturstiftung des Bundes, has so far uncovered more than 32,000 objects in 30 institutions worldwide.
It will be particularly important to listen to the needs and priorities of African museum and heritage professionals. El Hadji Malick Ndiaye, a Dakar-based art historian, sees the restitution debate as nothing less than an opportunity to recalibrate cultural diplomacy between European and African states. At the moment, he says, African museums collaborate with European partners on exhibitions in Europe, but it’s a one-way street: European museums seldom contribute to exhibitions in Africa.
Correcting the Errors of History
Restitution could build trust and open the door to more cooperation. It also “poses the challenge to African states to attach more importance to museum policy” and “will contribute to a real awareness of heritage and its impact on society,” Ndiaye says.
Kimani Njgogu of the Nairobi-based public policy organization Twaweza Communications is holding webinars with researchers and activists in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda to define restitution strategies. To Njgogu, Germany’s moves towards handing over the Benin bronzes are “inspirational.”
“It’s recognition that these things are possible and our requests for moral responsibility are being heard,” he says. “We would have expected more from other colonial powers and Germany was not as present (in Africa) as France and the UK, but Germany is more deliberate in terms of correcting the errors of history. We need much more consciousness of that responsibility to fix things related to the past.”

99,Restitution of Art Objects: Bringing in African Perspectives ...,https://trafo.hypotheses.org/17811,"Restitution of Art Objects: Bringing in African Perspectives
By Wazi Apoh and Andreas Mehler
The debate on the restitution of colonially-‘acquired’ art objects from Africa is boiling in Paris and Berlin, but in other quarters of the world it has not even started. The silence in the United Kingdom and also in many of the concerned African countries is baffling.
Just recently, German Secretaries of State, Monika Grütters and Michelle Müntefering published a high-profile article in the leading daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung with far-reaching suggestions, inter alia, asking to bring the debate into German schoolbooks and university amphitheatres. The German epistemic community has pushed the topic even further, with the latest initiative being a petition to build a central memorial for the victims of German colonialism. In France, President Macron set the tone when he declared in late 2017 that all art objects stolen from Africa should be returned. While domestically in defensive mode (in regards to issues like the yellow jackets), internationally, the French President often holds a vanguard position. Also to this case, Macron has commissioned a report by the Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and the French art historian Bénédicte Savoy. Its release in December has pushed things even further. French museums are now under strong pressure to start restitution processes.
A source of concern is the metropolitan bias of this debate. There is hardly any attention given to the demands and voices raised within Africa. The trigger of the German debate was clearly the pending inauguration of the controversial Humboldt Forum in Berlin. Emotions run high along German ideological fault-lines and much of the debate is centred on the future of ethnographic museums and collections between Hamburg and Stuttgart, and from Cologne to Dresden. But what is happening in Africa?
Arguably, the place where discussions are being held is an important condition to the context of its content. In December 2018, a group of African and European scholars, museum practitioners, heritage custodians and policy-makers gathered at the University of Ghana. They discussed the shortcomings and inadequacies in the current debate on restitution and provenance in a different fashion. The trust towards European museums and governments was visibly low with African participants as long as there is only talk about and not palpable acts of restitution. Furthermore, researchers asked for free access to inventories and catalogues of European museums as there is little transparency in what is stocked in repositories, where only a minimal fraction of objects ever make it to exhibitions. The far-reaching statement at the close of the event raised attention in the epistemic community, but was not widely publicised by the media. More of such gatherings will have to take place in the sub-regions of Africa and at more specific places of origin.
The year 2019 will see the return to Africa of some (symbolically) highly valued objects. Among those are the bible and the whip of Hendrik Witbooi, the Nama leader who opposed German colonial expansion in today’s Namibia. Negotiations on the terms, circumstances and participants of the entire procedure were lengthy and painful. One could learn from this and other cases with the aim of formulating best practices for the governance of restitution processes, including a) early negotiation of terms of reference between the relevant partners (museums, governmental bodies, communities); b) clarification of any competing claims on the objects themselves; c) approximate timelines for additional research on the objects’ provenance (if deemed necessary); d) validation of the authenticity of restituted objects; e) joint development of exhibition policies between the source community, country of origin and European museums that transfer objects to Africa.
What is also lacking is true engagement from the official African side. For example, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS) are absent from the current discussion (as is, by the way, the European Union). Potentially even more important would be concrete ideas and initiatives by the Regional Economic Communities, i.e. the sub-regional organisations within Africa. A good number of objects stemming from today’s ‘transborder communities’ were acquired with the use of force in precolonial times. Who could clearly say whether a Fang mask has to return to Gabon, Cameroon or Equatorial Guinea? Some initial colonial boundaries have shifted over time, such as the case of former German Togoland that is now ensconced within the Ghana-Togo sovereign and border lands. This brings to the fore the local, national, sub-regional, continental and transregional aspects of restitution; there are issues of participation, legitimacy and ownership at stake at all levels. Thus, the need to take the discussions of restitution to source regions is key to this unfolding ‘drama’ of restitution processes.
It is also quite obvious that the debate on restitution contains many new opportunities – for interdisciplinary research (not only in museum didactics, anthropology and history, but also in archaeology, law and political science), but first and foremost for ‘reciprocal research’ and for truly ‘transregional studies’. African research inquiring into European practices of initial collectors, the trajectory of the art market with African objects, (the shortcomings of) provenance research, and museum exhibition policies etc. would certainly set new priorities and shed a different light on one of the key aspects of colonisation and decolonisation: the formation of identity and alterity via the representations of transferred objects.

The Book
Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen. Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes – a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections. The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museum, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.

101,Germany to return Benin Bronzes looted during colonial era,https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/nation/germany-to-return-benin-bronzes-looted-during-colonial-era/article_ffa43fa2-7607-5e1a-a9ea-41b3bc4909c9.html,"Germany to return Benin Bronzes looted during colonial era
BERLIN (AP) — Germany is returning hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes that were mostly looted from West Africa by a British colonial expedition and subsequently sold to collections around the world, including German museums, authorities said Friday.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas welcomed a deal reached with museums and authorities in Nigeria to work on a restitution plan for a substantial number of artifacts, calling it a “turning point in dealing with our colonial history.”
Germany’s minister for culture, Monika Gruetters, said the Benin Bronzes were a key test for the way the country deals with its colonial past.
“We are confronting our historic and moral responsibility,” she said.
Gruetters said the goal is to contribute to “understanding and reconciliation” with the descendants of those whose cultural treasures were stolen in colonial times. The first returns are planned for next year, she said.
A historian welcomed the plans, but said they don't go far enough.
“Sadly, there is neither a precise time plan nor an unconditional commitment to restitute all looted artifacts,” said Juergen Zimmerer, professor of global history at the University of Hamburg.
He also noted it's not yet clear how many objects will be returned, or whether there will be any recognition of the efforts by civil society groups that had called for the restitution.
A British colonial expedition looted vast numbers of treasures from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897, including numerous bas-reliefs and sculptures.
While hundreds of artifacts ended up in the British Museum, hundreds were also sold to other collections such as the Ethnological Museum in Berlin, which has one of the world's largest collection of historical objects from the Kingdom of Benin, estimated to include about 530 items, including 440 bronzes.
The British Museum doesn't currently have plans to return parts of its collection.
“The devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897 is fully acknowledged,” the British Museum said in a statement, adding that the circumstances around the acquisition of Benin objects is explained in gallery panels and on its website.
“We believe the strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest or peaceful exchange,” it said.
But Zimmerer, who has done extensive historical research on the Benin Bronzes, said the decision by Germany would likely affect the wider debate about how institutions in former colonial countries should handle such artifacts.
“The pressure will grow, because the British position of simply not addressing the issue of restitution is no longer sustainable,” he said.

102,"Amid Black Lives Matter Protests, Is It Time to Repatriate ...",https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/28/time-repatriate-africa-looted-art-artifacts-cultural-heritage-benin-bronzes-nigeria-ghana-europe-british-museum/,"On the eve of Feb. 9, 1897, the ancient Kingdom of Benin, now part of modern-day Nigeria, stood as a marker for the achievement of Black civilizations. Archaeologists describe Benin City’s earthworks as the world’s largest built before the mechanical age, and its city walls were estimated to have been “four times longer than the Great Wall of China.” But the next day, the British military entered the city to overthrow Benin’s king by force. By Feb. 18, soldiers had burned Benin City to the ground. After Benin’s fall, the British donned blackface and faux native dress to celebrate.
The art from its royal palace and civilian homes was looted during a 10-day massacre described in the British National Archives as a “punitive expedition”—a punishment for the Benin king’s men killing seven British officials demanding control of regional trade. At least 3,000 artifacts—known as the Benin Bronzes—were stolen and taken to Britain, with 40 percent sent to the British Museum. The remaining loot was sold to private collectors and galleries across Europe and the United States. Much of it ended up in major Western museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.
More than a century later, Nigeria is Africa’s biggest economy, but a large number of its historical artworks remain outside the country. It’s a familiar story across Africa: 90 to 95 percent of Africa’s heritage is held outside the continent, according to a 2018 report commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron. Given the shameful manner in which African artifacts were taken and the collapse of the colonial empires that enabled the looting, it is time for European institutions to reevaluate claims of restitution. In Africa, there are a number of new museums planned with a mission to empower citizens with this cultural heritage that could receive the artifacts.
As Black Lives Matter protests spread globally in June, anger directed at statues memorializing slavers and colonialists soon turned to Western museum collections. Activists urged museums to return art and artifacts taken from African countries under colonialism or offer direct financial compensation. Last month, protesters unsuccessfully attempted to remove a 19th-century South Sudanese funeral pole from the Quai Branly Museum in Paris. “I will bring to Africa what was taken,” the Congolese artist Mwazulu Diyabanza, who led the demonstration, said in a video posted online. “Most of the works were taken during colonialism, and we want justice.”
The protests have strengthened calls to decolonize museums, but little has happened so far in terms of restitution. For example, London’s Victoria and Albert Museum responded to Ethiopia’s request for the return of plundered treasures with an offer to loan the items to Ethiopia for the long term. Private auction houses have also come under fire for selling items removed during Nigeria’s civil war. Despite an online petition and a strongly worded letter from Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments calling for Christie’s to halt the sale of sacred Igbo sculptures in Paris, the auction went ahead in June and fetched 212,500 euros (about $240,000).
The British Museum in London holds at least 73,000 objects from sub-Saharan Africa. France holds 90,000 artifacts, most of which were stolen during its colonial rule over much of the region. Belgium’s controversial Royal Museum for Central Africa holds more than 120,000 artifacts—mostly taken from the Belgian Congo during King Leopold II’s regime, which was characterized by slavery, rape, and mutilation and resulted in the killing of at least 10 million Congolese. Germany’s Humboldt Forum holds around 75,000 artifacts, including 10,000 objects looted by German troops during the Maji Maji uprising against colonial rule in present-day Tanzania. Around 300,000 locals were killed.
These Western museums have done little to recount the violence used to procure these artifacts or reflect on the millions of African lives lost. Hartwig Fischer, the British Museum’s director, expressed “solidarity with the British Black community, with the African American community, with the Black community throughout the world,” in a statement in June, adding that the museum would “continue to research, acknowledge and address the colonial history of Britain and its impact on our institution.” But critics described the response as performative. In an open letter, the visual artist Bayryam Mustafa Bayryamali wrote that he was disappointed that “it took the death of an unarmed Black man for you to join the conversation.” “The issue of repatriation is essential,” he said.
In practice, the British Museum has dismissed all restitution claims. Geoffrey Robertson, a prominent human rights lawyer, told the Guardian that “the trustees of the British Museum have become the world’s largest receivers of stolen property.” The “barbaric manner of the taking of the [Benin] Bronzes amounted to a war crime,” Robertson wrote in his 2019 book, Who Owns History?.
African countries that have sought restitution of artworks and artifacts include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal. But in response to restitution claims, Western collectors have expressed concern that African museums lie semi-derelict and lack the security to stop the pilfering of their few remaining objects. Bernard de Grunne, the Brussels-based dealer who sold the controversial Nigerian sculptures to Christie’s in 2010, recently cited a common defense. By coming to the West, “these great works of art were saved for the world to admire at that point, instead of being burned and destroyed during the war,” de Grunne told the New York Times.
African countries have responded by constructing new facilities and promoting them as potential homes for repatriated art and artifacts, including Senegal’s Museum of Black Civilisations, completed in December 2018 and founded to address the “cultural devaluation” of Black achievements. A private museum funded by Yemisi Shyllon, one of Africa’s biggest art collectors, recently opened in Lagos, Nigeria. It houses more than 1,000 artworks donated by Shyllon, including treasures dating to the 16th-century Benin Kingdom. In Togo, the Palais de Lomé, a former seat of German and French colonial power, has been transformed into a space for cultural heritage. Others include Congo’s National Museum and the planned Benin Royal Museum in Nigeria.
Shyllon, a Yoruba prince from Nigeria’s southwest, began his own collection of more than 7,000 African artworks—mainly contemporary—when he was an engineering student at the University of Ibadan in the 1970s. For now, he isn’t advocating for restitution: Shyllon is eager to see better state funding of Nigeria’s cultural sector beforehand, he said. At present, he wants a deal in which the British Museum acknowledges Benin City’s rights. “They will pay us royalties for those works because they acknowledge our legal ownership,” Shyllon told Foreign Policy.
As in Benin City, British troops mounted a punitive expedition against Ghana’s Ashanti people in 1874, looting several gold treasures from the king’s palace that were largely auctioned off, with the rest obtained by London’s Victoria and Albert and the Wallace Collection. The artifacts include a nearly life-size gold head, which Ghana’s government requested back in 1974. It came as no surprise that the British government reaffirmed its position that items in its collections cannot be returned.
But the Ghanian writer Nana Oforiatta Ayim has called the repatriation of some objects “inevitable.” She curated Ghana’s first ever presence at the Venice Biennale in 2019 and has created a different concept of the exhibit in Ghana: a traveling museum that hands over the control of narratives to communities. She is also a part of the Open Society Foundations’ four-year, $15 million initiative to help African nations get back cultural objects from Europe.
Whether this monetary might will force institutions to reconsider restitution claims remains to be seen. Twelve African heads of state, including major players such as Nigeria and South Africa, recently added some foreign-policy weight to the repatriation debate by committing to “speed up the return of cultural assets” during the African Union’s summit in Addis Ababa in February.
But action from European institutions has been polarized. In 2019, Germany agreed on guidelines for restitution and set aside more than $2 million into provenance research of objects held by German institutions. Likewise, Macron equally positioned himself as a leader willing to hear demands on restitution. “African heritage cannot be a prisoner of European museums,” he tweeted during a 2017 trip to Burkina Faso. After commissioning the 2018 report, which recommended that African treasures in French museums be returned, Macron vowed to repatriate 26 looted objects to the country of Benin—not to be confused with Benin City in Nigeria.
But the president hasn’t yet delivered on this promise. So far, only one repatriation has occurred: the temporary return of Senegal’s saber, owned by the 19th-century leader Omar Saidou Tall. That is because final parliamentary legislation is needed to return treasures: European laws forbid museums from giving away items in collections. Macron also faces scrutiny from museum professionals. That report “cannot be a blueprint for policy,” Emmanuel Kasarhérou, the head of the Quai Branly, said recently.
Even so, these initiatives still reflect a shift in government thinking with which the United Kingdom is increasingly out of step. British institutions there are pushing various loan terms rather than restitution. The British Museum presented such a deal to the Benin Royal Museum, set to open in 2023—but in all agreements, the British institution would retain legal ownership of all artifacts. Talks have been ongoing for over a decade.
The Nigerian government has previously purchased small Benin Bronzes from the British Museum, but there is growing resentment among Nigerians toward repeating such a move. The loan suggestions have been met with criticism. The Nigerian artist Victor Ehikhamenor, a member of the Benin Dialogue Group, a consortium of European museums and the Nigerian government, has called the arrangement an “insult.” “These loan agreements assume that they have a legal right to those works,” Shyllon said. “When somebody is possessing something that doesn’t belong to him or her but insists on lending it to the owner of the works, I think it is odd.”
The Benin Bronzes, which include carved ivory, bronze statues, and brass plaques commemorating various conquests, are an integral part of Nigeria’s national story. The British Museum has possessed the artifacts for more than 100 years, but the institution has no Black curators. And ordinary citizens lack a fundamental understanding of Nigerian history: Indeed, one-third of Britons believe that countries are better off having been colonized by the British, according to a YouGov poll.
African countries with developed economies deserve to tell their own stories without a European filter. Western museums could offer curator residencies to African historians, with the ultimate goal of reuniting some artifacts with African people in the countries they were taken from. After all, the British Museum exhibits just 1 percent of its 8 million objects, while the rest are hidden in storage. Around 100 Benin Bronzes are displayed out of a bounty of 900 items. It can afford to repatriate a fraction.
In Lagos, Shyllon’s own living room is dominated by an 8-foot-tall statue, with intricately carved figurines that recount Earth’s creation according to Yoruba folklore. Part of the story goes that Olodumare, seen as the supreme being, authorized the deities Obatala and Oduduwa to create land between the sky and the ocean below. In exhibits across Europe, I have often seen the bronze heads of Oduduwa, regarded as the founder of the kingdoms of Ife and Benin, displayed entirely devoid of this cultural context. Shyllon said these works “represent our civilization. They represent what our forefathers were able to contribute.”
Museums now face a moral reckoning over artifacts stolen by people who took colonial violence and racial superiority as a given.

About This Book
Walk into any European museum today and you will see the curated spoils of Empire. They sit behind plate glass: dignified, tastefully lit. Accompanying pieces of card offer a name, date and place of origin. They do not mention that the objects are all stolen. Few artefacts embody this history of rapacious and extractive colonialism better than the Benin Bronzes - a collection of thousands of metal plaques and sculptures depicting the history of the Royal Court of the Obas of Benin City, Nigeria. Pillaged during a British naval attack in 1897, the loot was passed on to Queen Victoria, the British Museum and countless private collections. The story of the Benin Bronzes sits at the heart of a heated debate about cultural restitution, repatriation and the decolonisation of museums. In The Brutish Museum, Dan Hicks makes a powerful case for the urgent return of such objects, as part of a wider project of addressing the outstanding debt of colonialism.",,2021-01-01,get access 500000 title brutish museum brutish museum book walk european museum today see curated spoil empire sit behind plate glass dignify tastefully lit accompany piece card offer name date place origin mention object steal artefact embody history rapacious extractive colonialism well benin bronze collection thousand metal plaque sculpture depict history royal court obas benin city nigeria pillage british naval attack 1897 loot pass queen victoria british museum countless private collection story benin bronze sits heart heat debate cultural restitution repatriation decolonisation museum brutish museum dan hick make powerful case urgent return object part wider project address outstanding debt colonialism,get access 500000 titl brutish museum brutish museum book walk european museum today see curat spoil empir sit behind plate glass dignifi tast lit accompani piec card offer name date place origin mention object stolen artefact embodi histori rapaci extract coloni better benin bronz collect thousand metal plaqu sculptur depict histori royal court oba benin citi nigeria pillag british naval attack 1897 loot pass queen victoria british museum countless privat collect stori benin bronz sit heart heat debat cultur restitut repatri decolonis museum brutish museum dan hick make power case urgent return object part wider project address outstand debt coloni
104,University to return Benin bronze | News | The University of ...,https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/14790/,"The University of Aberdeen is to return a Benin bronze - a sculpture looted by British soldiers in Nigeria in one of the most notorious examples of the pillaging of cultural treasures associated with 19th century European colonial expansion.
Thousands of metal and ivory sculptures and carvings were looted by British forces in 1897 during the destruction of Benin City in present-day Nigeria by a British military expedition.
Many of the soldiers and administrators involved sold Benin objects to museums or private collectors. Others were later given as gifts to museums or sold at auction or by art dealers.
Over the last 40 years there have been growing calls for the return of such items, which have become symbols of injustice.
A number of museums have been discussing the Benin bronzes in their collections and are supporting the creation of the Edo Museum of West African Art in Benin City to display the returned items under agreements wrought by all parties.
The University of Aberdeen instigated a conversation through Professor Bankole Sodipo, Professor of Law in Babcock University, Nigeria with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments of Nigeria through its Legal Adviser, Babatunde Adebiyi, the Edo State Government through the then Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Professor Yinka Omorogbe and the Royal Court of the Oba of Benin through Prince Professor Gregory Akenzua in 2020.
The Nigerian Federal Government gave its backing through the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture and its Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.
This conversation has now led to the University of Aberdeen becoming the first institution to agree to the full repatriation from a museum of a Benin bronze.
The bronze sculpture depicting an Oba (king) of Benin was acquired by the University in 1957 at an auction and is considered a superb example of Benin Late Period Art.
Benin City was the centre of a powerful and long-lasting kingdom in West Africa of the Edo people, renowned for its tradition of high-quality metalworking from at least the 17th century.
The expansion of British trade and colonial control in the later 19th century brought it into conflict with the kingdom of Benin, ultimately leading, in 1897, to the city being attacked and destroyed by a British military expedition, the “Benin Punitive Expedition”, with many inhabitants killed. The royal palace was burned and looted, and the Oba, Ovonramwen Nogbaisi, exiled.
The thousands of religious and cultural treasures seized have become known as the Benin bronzes.
Neil Curtis, Head of Museums and Special Collections said “The University of Aberdeen has previously agreed to repatriate sacred items and ancestral remains to Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and has a procedure that considers requests in consultation with claimants.
“An ongoing review of the collections identified the Head of an Oba as having been acquired in a way that we now consider to have been extremely immoral, so we took a proactive approach to identify the appropriate people to discuss what to do.”
An expert panel, including academic specialists and curators, as well as representatives of the University Court, the Hunterian Museum in the University of Glasgow and the Nigerian claimants, discussed the proposal in detail and unanimously recommended its return to Nigeria.
On Tuesday the University’s governing body supported the unconditional return of the Benin bronze to Nigeria.
Professor George Boyne, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen said: “I welcome the decision of the University of Aberdeen Court to support the return of the Benin bronze. This is in line with our values as an international, inclusive university and our foundational purpose of being open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others.
“It would not have been right to have retained an item of such great cultural importance that was acquired in such reprehensible circumstances. We therefore decided that an unconditional return is the most appropriate action we can take, and are grateful for the close collaboration with our partners in Nigeria.”
Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture of Nigeria said: “The reaching out by the University of Aberdeen and eventual release of the priceless antiquity is a step in the right direction. Other holders of Nigerian antiquity ought to emulate this to bring fairness to the burning issue of repatriation”.
The Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Professor Abba Issa Tijani said that: “the world looks forward to further release of other purloined Nigerian antiquities to the Nigerian nation. Not just Benin bronzes, but the Ife, Nok, Esie, Owo and other Nigerian ancient arts. We welcome collaborations and agreements of all sorts. We love the fact that others cherish these great art-works. International travelling exhibitions of these art-works is part of what we offer the world”.
The University is now making practical arrangements for the return of the Head of an Oba, and collaborating in organising a celebratory event to mark its return home.
The proposed Edo Museum of West African Art being championed by Godwin Obaseki, the current Governor of Edo State in Nigeria where the ancient kingdom of Benin falls. This modern museum will be part of an unprecedented cultural hub that will include this museum and other cultural heritage infrastructure including the Oba’s Palace.
It is being executed through the establishment of an independent trust (The Legacy Restoration Trust) established by the Edo State Government in collaboration with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, and the Royal Benin Palace. This cultural hub is designed by the eminent architect, Sir David Adjaye. This Benin bronze being returned will ultimately be housed in this proposed museum.
The Governor of Edo State stated, “I am looking forward to working with the Legacy Restoration Trust, the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, the Royal Palace and the University of Aberdeen to ensure that this object is returned safely and securely, and eventually housed in the Edo Museum of West African Art.”",,2021-03-25,university aberdeen return benin bronze sculpture loot british

106,L'Allemagne va restituer au Nigeria des « bronzes du Bénin »,https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2021/04/30/l-allemagne-va-restituer-au-nigeria-des-bronzes-du-benin_6078608_3212.html,"L’Allemagne prévoit de restituer au Nigeria à partir de 2022 des sculptures désignées comme « bronzes du Bénin » issues de pillages remontant à l’époque coloniale, a annoncé jeudi 29 avril au soir la secrétaire d’Etat à la culture Monika Grütters.
Cette décision a été prise lors d’une réunion entre experts de musées et responsables politiques nationaux et régionaux organisée à l’initiative de Mme Grütters. « Nous voulons contribuer à la compréhension et à la réconciliation avec les descendants de ceux dont les trésors culturels ont été dérobés pendant la colonisation », a-t-elle indiqué dans un communiqué. « Nous prévoyons les premières restitutions au cours de l’année 2022 », a-t-elle ajouté.
Les musées devront d’ici au 15 juin publier une liste détaillée de l’ensemble des bronzes en leur possession. Une nouvelle réunion fin juin devra déterminer le calendrier des restitutions. Cette décision constitue « un tournant dans notre rapport à notre histoire coloniale », a estimé le chef de la diplomatie allemande Heiko Maas dans un communiqué.
Les bronzes du Bénin figurent parmi les artefacts les plus réputés de l’art africain. Ces plaques, avec leurs bustes et sculptures en laiton fabriquées entre le XVIe et le XVIIIe siècle, décoraient le palais royal du royaume du Bénin, dans ce qui est aujourd’hui le sud-ouest du Nigeria. Elles avaient été réparties dans plusieurs musées européens après le pillage du pays par les Britanniques à la fin du XIXe siècle.
Plus de 400 bronzes
Le musée ethnographique du Forum Humboldt de Berlin, qui devrait accueillir cette année ses premiers visiteurs après une rénovation complète, possède environ 530 objets historiques, dont plus de 400 bronzes issus de l’ancien royaume du Bénin. Cette collection est présentée comme la plus importante du genre après celle du British Museum de Londres.
La réouverture du Forum Humboldt, sur la célèbre Ile aux musées de la capitale allemande, s’est accompagnée d’une vive controverse sur l’opportunité d’exposer de telles œuvres. L’ambassadeur du Nigeria en Allemagne, Yusuf Tuggar, avait à cette occasion demandé leur restitution. « Une approche sincère de l’histoire coloniale inclut également la question de la restitution des biens culturels », avait déclaré fin mars M. Maas.
En Europe, la plupart des anciennes puissances coloniales ont lancé ces dernières années des réflexions sur la réappropriation de leur patrimoine par les anciens pays colonisés, surtout africains. Le British Museum s’est prononcé pour un retour de certaines œuvres au Nigeria, mais sous la forme de prêt.
Le Nigeria veut construire un nouveau musée pour exposer les précieux bronzes. Le futur bâtiment devrait sortir de terre à la fin 2024 à Benin City (Etat d’Edo), à partir d’un financement initial de 3,4 millions d’euros, auquel participe le British Museum.

107,"Black Lives Matter, Benin Bronzes and Britishness: how can ...",https://advisor.museumsandheritage.com/features/black-lives-matter-benin-bronzes-and-britishness-how-can-uk-museums-decolonise/,"2020 will inevitably be remembered as the year a pandemic engulfed the world. If Covid-19 hadn’t come to dominate all aspects of existence, however, the last eight months may well have belonged far more exclusively to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Events such as the toppling of Edward Colston’s statue into Bristol Harbour and the British Museum redisplaying the bust of its founder, Sir Hans Sloane, have punctuated a summer in which the heritage sector has been put under the microscope for its record on institutional racism, diversity and inclusion.
The most recent Arts Council England diversity report painted a “disappointing picture”, according to chair Nicholas Serota, with figures for non-White people occupying senior roles lagging behind other industries.
Arts Council England diversity report reveals “disappointing picture”
One direct offshoot from this year’s intense discussion of museums’ duty to change was the publication of a Black Lives Matter Charter by arts charity Culture&. The resource was not launched immediately after George Floyd’s death – unlike the plethora of museum statements expressing solidarity with the Black community – but after several weeks of consultation.
“The reason we didn’t react immediately was that we knew it needed a considered response,” explains Dr Errol Francis, artistic director and CEO of Culture&. This approach was not the sector norm, with many museums falling into the trap of issuing what Francis labels “knee jerk” responses.
“I actually think in some ways the institutions that didn’t speak were being more honest,” he tells Advisor. “The ones that did speak, you couldn’t reconcile their statements with their records on repatriation or employment. Making the statements drew attention to the museums’ failures on these matters.”
One post which drew an especially high level of ire came from British Museum director Hartwig Fischer. While the institution was lambasted on social media for its statement which claimed to be “aligned with the spirit and soul of Black Lives Matter everywhere”, Professor Dan Hicks was struck most by the organisation’s lack of preparedness for such a backlash.
“I do think the people who wrote that statement and many across the museums sector were surprised that you could put something like that out and immediately the public would link it to restitution. The British Museum has fought to situate itself at the centre of debate about world culture. Therefore, what happened when they put out that statement was that the reaction came from the whole world.”
The curator of world archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum is keen to emphasise that, despite being emblematic of the sector’s problems in this case, the British Museum is in no way out of the ordinary. “My institution is as equally to blame as any other. We haven’t done enough; we haven’t previously thought enough about the histories from which these artefacts were extracted.”
The British Museum, Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum and several other UK sites host controversial Benin Bronzes acquired in a brutal looting tantamount to genocidal violence, according to Errol Francis. “It’s abundant, it’s shocking and distressing to read the accounts from 1897 of how the British came by those objects,” he says.
Dan Hicks concurs, believing the process to atone for past errors is long overdue. “In 1946, after fascism was defeated, one of the first things that happened here was that racist displays of skulls were removed. They were telling a story, a lie, about racial superiority. Items such as the Benin Bronzes were left on display despite doing exactly the same thing but with cultural objects rather than human remains.”
Protracted progress
The launch of Culture&’s Charter was designed to provide clarity and help support organisations unsure of how to tackle decolonising their collections and practices. While the outpouring of support for Black Lives Matter protesters suggested a strong appetite for change, engagement with the new resource tells a very different story. Only the Wellcome Collection and Museums Association have made contact.
Action not conversation the goal for arts and heritage Black Lives Matter Charter
“It’s quite typical,” Errol Francis says. “The Wellcome Collection have reached out, but that in itself is very telling. The first major UK museum with a black director – Melanie Keen – is the only one to engage with us.”
Resistance to change or the glacial pace of decision-making is not something that shocked the arts charity. “We didn’t have any illusions,” Francis adds. “It will take much more time and campaigning to get museums to sign up to some or all of the Charter. This is a long struggle.”
Dan Hicks, whose new book The Brutish Museums: the Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution will be published in November, believes the time for heel dragging must be over. “Dialogue is important but we also need action, the process needs to happen at a far greater pace. I attended a protest about the Edward Colston statue in 1998. How long does it take to have a proper conversation and reach a conclusion?”
This urgency does not, however, countenance an approach that is anything less than thorough. “It’s about the careful dismantling of things which are hurtful and the subsequent repurposing or rebuilding necessary,” Hicks states. “What is required is a case-by-case approach.”
“It’s a test for us as a sector to see how resilient we are, how willing we are to change so that we aren’t hurting people by allowing displays that are racist or hurtful in any other way to exist.”
Restitution is “fundamentally about listening to voices from the global south, Africa and African descendants in the UK and elsewhere”; an idea that should not be contentious, he continues.
“In the heritage world, when you consider planning regulations, we’re absolutely accustomed to reaching out to all stakeholders and listening to all relevant parties before coming to a decision. It’s uncontroversial in any other aspect of our practice.”
Hicks also wants to quash assertions that museums are in some way under attack for preserving what is rightfully theirs. “There is this idea that we will end up with the British Museum closed down and exhibition spaces across the country left empty. This argument winds up suggesting museums which were intimately bound up with anti-black violence are now somehow the victims.”
Rather than simply seeing items returned to their places of origin, Errol Francis thinks industry standard storytelling is also in need of a drastic refresh. “The role of connoisseurship in museums needs to be addressed,” he says. “There are a lot of areas of curatorial practice where the curator is not all-knowing. Working with other peoples’ experience and knowledge of shared history is a really interesting strategy and is one way of addressing the issues we’ve been talking about.”
Tate’s recent British Baroque: Power and Illusion is singled out by Francis as a “classic connoisseur, expert curated show” which could, and perhaps should, have been co-curated with someone possessing a specialistic knowledge of relevant social or political theory. “It was too narrowly art historical. The notion of an expert curator who constructs a very learned show is being challenged at the moment.”
Reinterpreting items with colonial histories or that have been acquired via dubious methods should also, in the Culture& CEO’s opinion, be informed by diverse voices. This process needn’t be confined to rejigging display cases and editing text on information labels, he adds, pointing to works by Yinka Shonibare that reinterpret through responsive art.
His Mr and Mrs Andrews Without Their Heads (1998) and Scratch the Surface (2007) exhibitions, both held at the National Gallery, took a swipe at the imperialist undertones of works by Gainsborough and Reynolds without damaging a thread on a canvas. “When people are discussing removal, we should be steering the conversation onto reinterpretation because destroying pieces of history sets a dangerous precedent,” Francis states. “This kind of methodology would be really good.”
Dan Hicks is in the early stages of a new three-pronged research endeavour focused on supporting efforts to return artefacts currently held in European collections to the continent of Africa. Organisations like Wellcome Collection and Museums Association have entered discussions with Culture&. Arts Council England are preparing conclusive industry guidance on restitution and repatriation. Things are happening, but not necessarily as quickly as some may like to see.
The important thing, at least in the eyes of those supporting efforts to make amends for colonial atrocities, is that the museums community acts to ensure today’s practices are viewed more favourably in the context of history than those of their forebears.
“I’m not sure when as a sector it was decided that any public art put on display must remain unchanged forever,” Hicks concludes. “It’s a test for us as a sector to see how resilient we are, how willing we are to change so that we aren’t hurting people by allowing displays that are racist or hurtful in any other way to exist.”",,2020-08-27,2020 inevitably remember year pandemic engulfed world

108,Germany officially agrees to hand back looted Benin bronzes ...,https://heritagetribune.eu/world/germany-officially-agrees-to-hand-back-looted-benin-bronzes-to-nigeria/,"On 29 April, the Benin Dialogue Group, made up of German political and cultural leaders, reached an agreement to return the Benin bronzes to Nigeria by 2022. The group wants to develop a road map for the return, which should be completed in the upcoming months. The bronze African artefacts will finally return home after British soldiers looted them in 1897.
The Benin Dialogue Group stated their intent to return “human remains and cultural objects from colonial contexts to their countries and societies of origin”, a press release read. Germany’s decision to hand back the looted artefacts might invite others to start restitution talks as well, the Benin Dialogue Group hoped.
Decolonise museums
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called the agreement a turning point in the country’s approach to colonial history. It aims to support Nigerian museums and partners after the Bronzes have returned home, according to the news platform Deutsche Welle. Maas explained this could include archaeological cooperations or the training of museum managers and assistance with cultural infrastructure.
Dutch anthropologist and curator at the Rautenstrach-Joest-Museum in Cologne, Nanette Snoep, underlined the importance of restitution in the trend to “decolonise” museums.
Nigerian partners can decide by themselves how this restitution will take place Nanette Snoep
However, Snoep emphasised that decisions on restitution need to be taken by the Nigerian partners themselves. Whether all the bronzes return to Africa or “if some of the looted art will remain in German museums, it must be their decision how we will represent the Benin artworks in our museums”, Snoep told Deutsche Welle.

En octobre 2018, peu avant la publication du rapport par Bénédicte Savoy et Felwine Sarr sur la restitution du patrimoine culturel africain, j'ai assisté à l'annonce officielle à Benin City des résultats d'une négociation pour le prêt à long terme d'un certain nombre d'objets spoliés en 1897. Résultat de huit années de discussions, cet accord reçoit une réception très contrastée en Europe. Il s'agit ici d'évoquer le contexte de sa réception à l'endroit même où ces objets ont été pris.
Le rapport préconise entre autres de restituer cinq pièces à Benin City au Nigeria, objets qui se trouvent aujourd'hui dans la collection du musée du quai Branly – bien modeste à côté de celles de Berlin ou de Londres en ce qui concerne ce type d'objets. En 1897, lors d'un raid dit punitif mené par les forces du protectorat et de l'amirauté britannique, le palais royal de l'Oba (roi) Ovonramwen fut pillé de plusieurs milliers d'objets – dont quelques-uns ont atterri à Paris, pour la plupart acquis après l'indépendance du Nigeria en 1960.
Le gouvernement nigérian n'a pas déposé de demande officielle auprès de l'État français pour la restitution de ces objets. D'une façon générale, refroidies par les refus des prêts réclamés dès les années 1970, les campagnes pour le retour des objets de Benin City, émanent plutôt de la cour royale et des membres de la diaspora que directement du gouvernement fédéral. Depuis les années 1980, à Benin City, les représentants de la cour et descendants directs de l'Oba exilé en 1897 jouent d'une « diplomatie douce » pour récupérer des éléments d'un trésor royal, un effort qui a donc tout récemment porté ses fruits.
L'engagement de prêts à moyen terme proposé par les musées européens membres du « Benin Dialogue Group », annoncé au mois d'octobre, nous offre l'occasion de comprendre les enjeux politiques et les attentes associées à la perspective d'un retour des objets.
Rendre, mais à qui ?
En effet, les négociations « d'État à État » n'ont rien d'évident dans le contexte des patrimoines en Afrique et le partage équilibré des responsabilités entre des instances nationales et des communautés d'origine dans des pays où l'identité nationale souffre encore de divisions très profondes est sans doute un enjeu central pour l'avenir des patrimoines, y compris hors de la question de la restitution.
Dans les débats récents, on a beaucoup mis l'accent sur les conflits que les restitutions pourraient provoquer, car la question de savoir « à qui rendre ? » comporte le risque de renforcer des politiques identitaires internes. Il s'agit là d'un problème à aborder avec soin et, sans aucun doute, Benin City ne peut pas et ne doit pas faire figure de cas général. Toutefois, on peut y observer un exemple du résultat d'une longue histoire de rapprochements et de collaborations entre différents acteurs de la politique patrimoniale à l'échelle des institutions traditionnelles, locales et fédérales tel que le musée national de Benin City, ouvert en 1973 à quelques pas du palais royal, sur la base de la collection de l'Oba (roi) Akenzua II offerte à la ville dans les années 1940. Ce musée propose par ailleurs la visite de l'« unity gallery », dont l'objectif idéologique est justement d'adresser le problème de la diversité culturelle au sein de la nation.
Depuis les années 1930, il est question de la gestion des absences et des négociations autour d'un patrimoine dispersé. Toutefois, la négociation de ces prêts à long terme en 2018 a été, en grande partie, rendue possible par la collaboration nouvellement renforcée entre la cour royale et le gouvernement fédéral local. Godwin Obaseki, élu en 2016 gouverneur de l'État Edo (dont la capitale est la ville de Benin City) est un grand collectionneur et mécène des arts. Pour les employés du musée national, son soutien au musée, sa récente rénovation et d'une façon générale son action pour la culture contrastent très fortement avec celui de son prédécesseur.
Un enjeu fondamental : retenir et faire revenir ce qui est précieux
Le 20 octobre 2018, lors d'une cérémonie au palais royal à Benin City marquant le deuxième anniversaire du couronnement d'Oba Eware II, le gouverneur Godwin Obaseki a énuméré les qualités de l'Oba (ou roi), détenteur d'un pouvoir dit traditionnel et avant tout représentatif.
Il joue, selon lui, un rôle phare dans la « redéfinition, la régénération et le repositionnement de la gloire et de l'essence du royaume » (propos recueillis et traduits par l'auteur) qu'il considère comme également applicable aux contours de son État. Les frontières de l'État Edo ont été déterminées en 1991 pour s'accorder à des revendications locales et sont en grande partie imputables à l'implication du grand-père et du père de l'Oba actuel. Obaseki a poursuivi son discours en louant le rôle de l'Oba, ce « compas moral », dans la lutte contre la migration illégale et le trafic d'êtres humains, puis a terminé son discours par l'annonce des résultats de la réunion tenue la veille des membres du groupe « Benin Dialogue » à Leiden : « un cadeau d'anniversaire digne de Sa Majesté », la promesse du retour des « reliques » de Benin City qui se trouvent aujourd'hui dans les musées européens.
La politique de l'Oba, telle que la présente le gouverneur actuel, se distingue par deux champs d'action. D'abord par sa volonté de maîtriser l'exode qui touche particulièrement les jeunes femmes de la région : Benin City est la principale ville d'origine des prostituées nigérianes présentes en Europe aujourd'hui. Puis, à travers son soutien du projet pour un nouveau musée royal, condition sine qua non au retour partiel des objets selon les termes des négociations du « Benin Dialogue Group ». Ce musée se veut aussi la réponse à un argument qui remonte aux premiers efforts pour le prêt de certains objets conservés au British Museum et à la Wallace Collection dans les années 1970, celle de la mise en doute de la capacité des autorités nigérianes à conserver et retenir sur leur territoire leurs objets les plus précieux.
La cérémonie a également marqué la sortie d'un ouvrage : The Benin Monarchy. An Anthology of Benin History, présenté comme « sept kilos d'histoire ».
Le livre est à la fois une somme de savoirs historiques et un objet précieux. Comprenant les contributions de dix-sept chercheurs, dont la plupart sont originaires de la région, il témoigne de la volonté très forte des éditeurs de se réapproprier l'écriture de l'histoire de Benin City. Il s'agit d'une histoire officielle, sanctionnée et vendue par et pour le profit de la maison royale et sa fondation, ainsi que d'un objet de diplomatie culturelle.
Dans cet ouvrage les travaux de l'anthropologue Kokunre Agbontaen-Eghafona, professeure à l'université de Benin City, incarnent le lien entre le départ des objets et la diaspora des jeunes femmes de la ville. Formée au Metropolitan Museum à New York où elle inventoria la Perls Collection des objets de Benin City, elle a dédié sa thèse aux objets que son père collectionnait, les sauvant ainsi de la vente ou de la destruction. Aujourd'hui toutefois, elle cherche surtout à comprendre le destin de ces filles qui partent pour l'Europe.
Vus de loin, les deux enjeux semblent a priori sans liens directs, mais sur place ils sont vécus comme deux rapports parallèles et critiques au monde extérieur : quelque part, à l'étranger, se trouvent les « reliques » et les enfants du pays.
Une forte mobilisation en Europe et à Benin City
Avec le lancement de cet ouvrage monumental par sa taille et par ses ambitions, l'annonce du gouverneur tombe à un moment de très forte mobilisation politique de l'histoire du royaume. Et dans ce contexte, la nature temporaire des retours proposés était peu, voire pas du tout mise en avant dans son discours public du 20 octobre 2018.
Si on célèbre ces retours, c'est en faisant largement abstraction du fait qu'il s'agisse de facto de prêts à moyen terme. L'annonce se référait en effet aux résultats de l'association « Benin Dialogue » qui réunit des conservateurs de musées européens et nigérians ainsi que des membres de la cour, des membres de la Commission nationale des musées et des monuments (NCMM) et depuis cette année seulement des représentants du gouvernement fédéral local.

The “Benin Plan of action for restitution” and what it means for the return of disputed artefacts
Meetings have been held in Nigeria, between representatives of the government & from various institutions abroad, that hold disputed Nigerian artefacts. The aim of this is to determine some way forward to resolving the issue. For an opinion on the viability of this, the second article I have reposted gives an alternative perspective to the official government line to the media.

Amid hope of restitution, Nigeria hosts foreign museums
Friday, 15 February 2013 00:00 By Tajudeen Sowole
AS Nigeria hosts some representatives of holders of the country’s looted cultural objects as part of efforts towards the return of the controversial artefatcs, the country’s dialogue or diplomatic approach is once again on the spot.
Scheduled to hold next week, significantly, in Benin, Edo State, where the largest looting of Africa’s cultural objects took place in 1897, the meeting would be the third of its kind between the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) and some museums in Europe.
In 2010 and 2011, the NCMM had engaged a number of major museums in similar meeting held in Vienna, Austria and Berlin, Germany. The Minister of Tourism, Culture and National Orientation, Chief Edem Duke had hinted about the scheduled Benin meeting during the repossession ceremony of some stolen Nok pieces from French Embassy, held in Abuja, few weeks ago.
Unspecified volumes of pre-19th century artefacts of Nigerian origin are currently in illegal possession of museums and individuals across Europe and the U.S. Among the most important cultural objects in this context are the two Queen Idia masks, each in the British Museum, U.K and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, U.S.
In recent years, other works of perhaps similar values had been brought into the public glare. For example, in 2010, Sotheby’s attempt at auctioning six pieces of Benin origin, including a pendant mask of Queen Idia from the descendants of Lionel Galway – the British colonial army who led the 1897 expedition – was stopped by formal protest from a Nigerian group in the Diaspora, Kayode Ogundamisi-led Nigeria Liberty Forum (NLF).
More recent in the restitution issue came last June when Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston, U.S received donation of 28 bronzes and six ivories from Mr. Robert Owen Lehman who is the heir to the vast collection of a famous American banker and collector, Philip Lehman. The late banker and great-grand father of Robert, according to sources, was one of the immediate beneficiaries of the 1897 Benin Punitive Expedition.
And as the donation also generated heated reactions from Nigerians, home and the Diaspora, NCMM sent a protest letter to MFA. The museum’s’s Associate Director of Public Relations, Karen Frascona, via email chat over Nigeria’s protest relayed the response of the museum: “Director, Malcolm Rogers responded to Mr. Usman (on August 30, 2012), that after careful deliberation, the Museum decided to accept the gift as a way of sharing this private collection, giving access to these long-hidden objects to our more than one million annual visitors.”
Rogers, according to Frascona, “conveyed his desire that the gift inaugurates fruitful dialogue with colleagues locally and abroad, and further opportunities for cultural exchange.”
Although, as at press time, it was unclear if MFA, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum were listed among the participants for the Benin dialogue, but the NCMM’s past romance with some museums seemed not to be yielding much progress in returning Nigeria’s priceless artefacts. For example, the British Museum has been involved in the retraining programme of NCMM’s staffs while Museum of African Art, New York offered similar trainings during the tour of a collaborative exhibition Dynasty and Divinity: Ife Art in Ancient Nigeria.
Although the return to Nigeria, by France, of the stolen and intercepted Nok pieces was a laudable one, but the ultimate restitution, which Nigerians look forward to eagerly, in the return of the Idia masks, currently under incarceration in the U.K and U.S. And as NCMM keeps going into these collaborations, observers noted that the real issue of restitution has been beclouded. It has also been noted that such collaborations gives strength to the holders of Nigerian artefacts to maintain the status quo.
While the Director-General of National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), Mallam Yusuf Abdallah Usman insisted that Nigeria’s “diplomatic approach” may not be on the table forever, he had argued that if Nigeria’s agitation for return of its stolen artefacts must enjoy consideration of the holders, it is important to demonstrate to the rest of the world that whenever the looted works are repatriated “we would share” with other people across the world.
It is of note that under the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the prohibition of illicit trade in Cultural property as well as the 1995 International Institute for the Unification of Private Law otherwise known as UNIDROIT Convention on unauthorised exportation of cultural objects, positive gestures have been coming from some countries. Before France’s return of Nok pieces few weks ago, the Homeland Security investigation (HSI) of U.S, had in July last year, returned some Nok terracotta to Nigeria’s Consulate. It was reported that the U.S. authority had been on the trail of the objects since 2011 after French customs officers spotted the statues during a routine inspection at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.
It has been observed that the UNESCO convention’s covert silence on the pre-1970 dispute artefacts could make the return of major and contentious works such as the Idia masks difficult.
The Director-General of NCMM categorized the illegal movements of Nigerian artefcats into three categories: the colonial period of invading forces by imperial Britain and other western anthropologists who carried out field work in various parts of the country; collections in the 1960s and 1970s when the civil war provoked large exodus artefacts outside Nigeria; the post-civil war and current movements of work through the porous borders.
“Within the last three years the Commission has embarked on several sensitization programme involving law enforcement agencies, media, local communities and traditional rulers at Abuja and Kaduna and also in the rural areas especially at Nok and Janjala,” Usman said.
The NCMM, he argued, has been consistent in protecting the endangered areas where artefacts are prone to illegal exportation. He disclosed that “Six hundred security personnel and craftsmen to police our heritage sites is awaiting cash backing from the Budget office.” What he described “a special repatriation Unit to handle issues of illicit trafficking, repatriation and restitution,” he added, has been approved by the government.

“BENIN PLAN OF ACTION FOR RESTITUTION”: WILL THIS ENSURE THE RETURN OF LOOTED BENIN ARTEFACTS?
“There are many ways to develop relationships besides returning museum objects. Informally, it also appears that the different kinds of collaboration that are currently in progress are important to Nigerian museums. That might explain why Nigeria has not registered any formal demand for the return of the Benin collections, but has preferred to engage in dialogue and cooperation. It seems that Nigeria is chary of bringing the matter to a head. How does one otherwise explain that the National Museum of Nigeria was willing to lend its extensive and unique collection of Ife art to the British Museum for a special exhibition in 2010, without demanding reciprocity?”(1)
Wilhelm Östberg, former director Museum of Ethnography, Stockholm.
When I first received the so-called Benin Plan of Action for Restitution (2), I was surprised by the title since this was the first time that holders of looted artefacts and the claimant owners have issued a joint plan of action even though the interest of the parties are diametrically opposed as far as restitution of the objects is concerned. Egypt, Italy and Turkey, have all obtained restitution of their artefacts without having to produce such a joint document with all the holders on one side and the claimant owner on the other side. Such a joint document has the tendency to amalgamate the specific histories of the acquisition of the artefacts by the present holders and confuse the approaches to be adopted towards specific holders of the artefacts. Austria, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands acquired the Benin artefacts under different circumstances.
When I read the contents of the text, I was flabbergasted. I simply could not believe what I was reading and when I saw the names of those who participated or were present at the three days of meeting between Nigeria’s National Commission for Monuments (NCMM) and representatives of holders of the looted Benin bronzes, I gasped. I know some of the persons named and even though I do not share their views, I respect them a lot. Reconciliation between what I was reading and the high reputation of these persons seems impossible. The history of the process of formulation of the so-called plan of action must be told one day by the participants.
The title, ”Benin Plan of Action for Restitution”, is clearly a misnomer for the document contains “no plan of action” but is an assemblage of propositions or proposals for a future memorandum of understanding. Under a plan of action, we expect a clearly defined objective and the enunciation of the ways and means proposed for achieving that objective. There is nothing like that in this document which, apart from the title, does not mention the word ”restitution” even once. It appears therefore that the document is, as it were, sailing under a false flag.
Is the use of the name, Benin intended to honour Benin City, the city from which the British stole some 3000 artefacts in the notorious invasion of 1897?
If so, I would expect the document to refer to the invasion of 1897 and to affirm
strongly the inalienable right of the right of the Oba of Benin and the people of Benin to recover the looted artefacts which are now in Western museums, (3) We noticed the absence of British and US American museums from the meeting in Nigeria. Museums in these States have a considerable number of the looted artefacts. Were these museums ever invited? Did they refuse to participate? How does the so-called plan of action stand in relation to these major holders of looted Benin artefacts in the USA and in Britain? Someone should explain to the Nigerian public the absence of the British Museum, Pitt Rivers Museum, the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Major museums in the USA have recently restituted a large number of artefacts to Greece, Italy and Turkey at their request. Will they refuse to do the same for Nigeria?
We now turn our attention to the specific propositions of the “Benin Plan of Action” and make brief comments thereon.
1. Developing a data bank by the collaborating institutions on Benin art collections in their holdings in form of a digital archive of electronic and hard copies. This data will be submitted and made available to the general public.
None of the participating museums has established such a data bank. The Ethnology Museum of Vienna certainly seems to have problems in establishing
a data bank of its acquisitions and refers to this at its homepage. A visit to the database of themuseum www.ethno-museum.ac.at shows some six Benin objects and we read that the rest of the objects are in the process of digitalization. How long this will take appears to be anybody’s guess. Incidentally, the African Section of the museum has been closed to the public for more than ten years because of repairs.
If the Ethnology Museum of Vienna takes so long in digitalization, how long will the NCMM take to complete its part? In any case, what relevance has digitalization to the restitution of looted artefacts?
Whilst waiting for the completion of the digitalization process, the museums could tell us exactly how many of the Benin artefacts are in their possession and whether they have sold any, like the British Museum did. They could also publish lists of the Benin objects with photos and information on their dates of acquisition and sources.
2. That all collaborating institutions upon request shall have right of producing free of charge photographs of Benin art objects in the collection of collaborating institutions particularly for scholarly purposes.
This is all very well but what does reproduction of photos of Benin art got to do with the restitution of the Benin artefacts? What about the profits the holding museums have derived from the fees they have been charging for all these decades? Will any part of that amount be handed over to the owners of the looted artefacts? Are Nigerian scholars expected to be satisfied with photos of the Benin objects and not the objects themselves? Nigerian scholars will be worse off than their Western colleagues who would have access to the original artefacts. Whose culture are we then dealing with?
3. That staff of the collaborating institutions shall have access to Benin Collections in their holdings in accordance with the existing procedures of the institutions.
What is new about this proposition that refers to existing procedures? Is it really relevant to the question of restitution?
4. That the National Commission for Museums and Monuments shall improve the university education of its staff working on the collections and on this basis collaborating institutions will assist in securing support for internship and scholarship for postgraduate studies on the Benin collections.
Is this the quid pro quo of the whole arrangement between the NCMM and the holding States? Improvement in education is always welcome under all circumstances. Can Nigeria with its own resources not cater for the education of those working in the museums? How long are Nigerian officials going to require education from abroad when there are universities and other institutions of education in one of the richest African States? What is the relevance of this education with the restitution of Benin artefacts? Is training being offered as compensation for not pressing the issue of restitution?
5. That collaborating institutions assist with expertise in the establishment of a conservation laboratory in Nigeria.
Why must the establishment of such an institution be discussed within the framework of arrangements for the restitution of Benin artefacts? After all, conservation is important for all arts and not only for Benin artefacts. Incidentally, how did the Benin Royal Family conserve these artefacts for centuries before they were looted by the British in 1897?
6. That collaborating institutions shall assist the National Commission for Museums and Monuments in developing its library and archive facilities.
Developing library and archive institutions will surely be good for any institution but what is the relevance of this proposition to the restitution of the Benin bronzes? Why must it be dealt with here in connection with the restitution of Benin artefacts?
7. That the National Commission for Museums and Monuments and collaborating museums shall create an enabling environment for an increased exchange of touring/travelling exhibitions for the Benin art objects and other art traditions where the European and Nigerian museum experts will work together in the planning and execution of such exhibitions.
That these individual steps are part of the dialogue which goal is to lead to the display of the objects in Nigeria.
The touring/travelling exhibitions of the Benin and other art/traditions have in recent years been extremely successful for example Benin- Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria ,2007 Vienna; Kingdom of Ife- Sculptures from West Africa ,2010, London. What new element does this proposition bring? Why is this raised in connection with the restitution of Benin artefacts? Or is this to implement the misleading and tendentious suggestion of Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum that“The value of an object is to explain history to as many people as possible and explain the present to as many people as possible that may not be achieved by being returned to the place where it was made. When you see these objects they will mean more to you in your own experience than they would in London or the place where they were made.” (4)
MacGregor thus contradicts one of the fundamental tenets of archaeology, namely, that objects are best understood in their original context where they were placed by those who made them. One can understand that the director of the venerable British Museum, with a huge number of plundered/stolen artefacts takes such a position but his statement contradicts not only archaeological principles but also common sense. The idea here, like most of the theories of the
British Museum director and his colleagues in the Western countries, is to ensure that owners of artefacts looted, stolen or taken under dubious circumstances, do not collect their artefacts from the British Museum, Metropolitan Museum, Louvre and other major museums. So any idea or theory that has the tendency to prevent, discourage or disarm owners of artefacts from making demands, is encouraged by Western museums.
These travelling/touring exhibitions do not go to Nigeria or any other African country. What benefits do the people of Nigeria derive from these shows?
We were surprised to read: That these individual steps are part of the dialogue which goal is to lead to the display of the objects in Nigeria. Until now we had been told that by the Director-General of NCMM that the dialogue with the holders of Benin artefacts would lead to restitution of the Benin artefacts. Now it appears that dialogue is to lead to the display of the artefacts in Nigeria. Is “display” now a substitute for restitution?
The meeting resolved that there is a need at the next meeting to discuss:
The issue of fake Benin art objects on the international art markets and its consequences for museums, The 1970 UNESCO Convention, The publication of their inventories
Why will anyone wish to discuss the issue of fake Benin art objects in the context of restitution of the looted Benin artefacts? Is this the concern of the NCMM or Western States that hold the vast number of original Benin artefacts? Who stands to lose if fakes flood the market and diminish the price of these objects? One can only assume that the holders of these artefacts would like to reassert a right they have claimed all along that they are the only ones who can certify the authenticity of Benin arts and other African art objects.
Should the NCMM help them in this matter? After having stolen the best of the Benin artefacts, the holders of the looted objects are worried by the existence of many imitations of the original which tend to create doubts and diminish the value of the originals but eventually spread the fame of some of the artefacts.
Queen-Mother Idia, pendant mask, Benin, Nigeria, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States of America
As we have often written training, internship and scholarships are no substitute for the precious artefacts that are part of Nigeria’s national treasures. (5) Self-respect demands that Nigeria recovers her stolen/looted treasures in the Western museums. The Director-General of the NCMM has in recent months reiterated the need for Nigeria’s artworks abroad to be returned: “For the avoidance of doubt we hereby place it on record that we demand, as we have always done, the return of these looted works and all stolen, removed or looted artefacts from Nigeria under whatever guise.”(6)
The so-called Benin Plan of Action for restitution does not appear to be aimed at recovering the Benin Bronzes that were looted with violence in 1897 and are now in many Western museums. The document seems aimed at postponing the restitution of the Benin Bronzes for a considerable period.One cannot avoid the impression that the propositions in the so-called plan reflect fairly closely the standard doubts expressed by holders of looted artefacts about the capacity of Nigeria to look after them. The doubts now appear as preconditions for discussions on restitution of the artefacts
The document reads more like a book of lamentations on all the weaknesses of the Nigerian museums system, a catalogue of diagnoses of the Nigerian museums. Such a text does not appear to be calculated to bring home quickly the precious national treasures to a system diagnosed to be seriously sick. Was this a condicio sine qua non of the holders of the holders of the looted artefacts? Greeks, Italians and Turks received back their looted artefacts without the holders insisting on confession and admission of their weaknesses. Why must Nigeria indulge in self-exposure without even a promise of restitution?
If we take the requirements seriously, it would take Nigeria at least 20 or more years to complete the tasks assigned before serious discussions on restitution could begin.
The name of Benin should not be associated with such a plan for it does no honour to those whose lives were sacrificed in the 1897 invasion.
The so-called Benin Plan of Action appears to be a step backwards.
“The exhibition is showcasing some of the works that made Benin (Nigeria) famous. It once again, reminds the world of a civilization truncated by the imperial forces of the colonialist. The works on show at this exhibition are some of the 3000 odd pieces of bronze and ivory works forcibly removed from my great grandfather’s palace by some Britons who invaded Benin in 1897. The British kept some of the loot for themselves and sold the rest to European and American buyers. These works now adorn public museums and private collector’s galleries, all over the world.” Oba Erediauwa, Oba of Benin. (7)

THURSDAY, 21 FEBRUARY 2013 ‘Benin Plan of Action’ for restitution
After three days of meeting between Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) and representatives of holders of Benin bronzes in foreign museums, here is what the gathering arrived at as “Benin Plan of Action”.
The plan of action signed by the Director-General of
NCMM, Yusuf Abdallah Usman states:
Museum professionals in Europe with holdings of Benin art collections and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments of Nigeria a scholar on copyright law and representatives of the court of Benin, met in Benin, Nigeria on the 19th and 20th of February 2013, in continuation of previous meetings in Vienna, Austria and Berlin, Germany and proposed that a Memorandum of Understanding be made between the collaborating institutions on the following issues:
1. Developing a data bank by the collaborating institutions on Benin art collections in their holdings in form of a digital archive of electronic and hard copies. This data will be submitted and made available to the general public.
2. That all collaborating institutions upon request shall have right of producing free of charge photographs of Benin art objects in the collection of collaborating institutions particularly for scholarly purposes.
3. That staff of the collaborating institutions shall have access to Benin Collections in their holdings in accordance with the existing procedures of the institutions.
4. That the National Commission for Museums and Monuments shall improve the university education of its staff working on the collections and on this basis collaborating institutions will assist in securing support for internship and scholarship for postgraduate studies on the Benin collections.
5. That collaborating institutions assist with expertise in the establishment of a conservation laboratory in Nigeria.
6. That collaborating institutions shall assist the National Commission for Museums and Monuments in developing its library and archive facilities.
7. That the National Commission for Museums and Monuments and collaborating museums shall create an enabling environment for an increased exchange of touring/travelling exhibitions for the Benin art objects and other art traditions where the European and Nigerian museum experts will work together in the planning and execution of such exhibitions.
That these individual steps are part of the dialogue which goal is to lead to the display of the objects in Nigeria.
The meeting resolved that there is a need at the next meeting to discuss:
The issue of fake Benin art objects on the international art markets and its consequences for museums, The 1970 UNESCO Convention, The publication of their inventories.
In attendance at the meeting were: Dr. Michael Barrett and Dr. Lotten Gustafsson-Reinius represented the National Museum of Ethnography of the Museums of World Culture Stockholm, Sweden Dipl. Ethn; Silvia Dolz of Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden, Staatliche Ethnographische Sammlungen Sachsen of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Germany; Dr. Peter Junge represented Ethnologisches Museum-Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Germany; Dr. Barbara Plankensteiner represented Museum für Völkerkunde, Vienna, Austria; Dr. Annette Schmidt represented the National Museum of Ethnology of the Netherlands.
Other participants included Rosemary Bodam, Peter Odeh, Babatunde Adebiyi, Prof. Folarin Shyllon, Prince Edun Egharese Akenzua MFR – Enogie of Obazuwa, Chief Stanley Obamwonyi – Esere of Benin.
ANNEX II LIST OF HOLDERS OF BENIN BRONZES
Almost every Western museum has some Benin objects. Here is a short list of some of the places where the Benin Bronzes are to be found and their numbers. Various catalogues of exhibitions on Benin art or African art also list the private collections of the Benin Bronzes. The museums refuse to inform the public about the number of Benin artefacts they have and do not display permanently the Benin artefacts in their possession since they do not have enough space. A museum such as Völkerkundemuseum, Vienna has closed since some 10 years the African section where the Benin artefacts were, apparently due to repair work.

111,"History, restitution and justice for African nations | odi.org",https://odi.org/en/insights/history-restitution-and-justice-for-african-nations/,"A recent court case is a good place to start as we consider how issues of history, restitution and justice intersect. It involves a young man of African descent entering a museum, attempting to remove looted African artefacts through direct action, in order to correct historical wrongs. Thirty-four year-old Isaiah Ogundele was convicted of harassing museum manager Henry Martin at Stratford Magistrates Court on 18 September 2020, following his loud protest against a display of Benin bronzes at the Museum of London Docklands in January 2020. As he tried to grab the bronze, it fell from its cabinet, clanging on the floor.
The trial of Isaiah Ogundele
It was strange sitting in court for the Ogundele trial – a small case, pregnant with meaning. I was the lone African as the accused did not show up for the hearing. It was not clear whether he had received the summons, or whether he indeed had a fixed abode for it to be delivered to, so he was tried and convicted in absentia. Not being there to defend himself, the prosecution presented evidence from staff at the Museum of London and from the police. The picture painted was kind of trope – a loud aggressive black man, acting erratically, who believed the bronze belonged to his family, and who talked about a history of family slavery and colonialism which continued to impact him and torment him to this day.
When repeated in evidence by the Museum of London staff and police reports, his words were troubling and captured years of grief and turbulence. But in the court, especially without his presence, they became just a series of cold and solemn entries shared between the prosecutors, court servants and the presiding magistrates, as they processed the inevitable criminalisation of another person of African descent.
From the tragic to the absurd
Among the tragedy, the whole scene also struck a level of absurdity, a little like the trial in Alice in Wonderland. There was the lion and unicorn herald overlooking proceedings, and the criminalising of a young man for merely shouting and accidentally damaging an object. Meanwhile those who violently looted the objects and killed thousands continue to be celebrated as heroes and have their rights to the booty defended so openly. In fact, the only thing missing was the cry ‘off with his head’.
One suspects this was fully the intention of the Crown Prosecution Service, perhaps to send a message of deterrence as part of an ongoing culture war. This despite the fact that the Museum of London, we understand, were reluctant to prosecute. I am sure they felt ethically uncomfortable in being placed in the position of a thief asserting their legal rights 123 years later, against a descendent of the punitive Benin raid, punishing the Africans again and again in what appears to be a ‘Groundhog Day’ of continuing retribution.P erhaps Frederic Bastiat, the French economist, commenting on issues of taxation, put it best in the Law:
“When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society, over the course of time they create for themselves a legal system that authorises it and a moral code that glorifies it.” (..and the perversion of language that enables it).
“But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.”
The economic benefits of restitution
Beyond a meditation on issues of fairness, justice and ethics, what might the Ogundele case tell us about development? There are indications that restitution could provide massive economic benefits for African countries.
An example of this is Ghana’s 2019 Year of Return initiative, which attracted over one million diaspora visitors and generated $1.9 billion in additional spending for the country, according to Ghanaian Minister of Tourism Barbara Oteng Gyasi. Like the frequently unacknowledged impact of diaspora remittances to Africa ($86 billion in 2018, and at $25 billion more than the federal budget in Nigeria), these figures outperform Official Development Assistance figures.
Other African countries are making the connection between returning artefacts, heritage and tourism policy, too. The Republic of Benin, for example, established a tourism agency for the promotion of heritage in 2016. For Benin, the restitution of cultural property has implications not only for attracting tourists, but also for cultural diplomacy and development more broadly.
Covid-19 and an African Spring
The Ogundele direct action in January preceded the killing of George Floyd but anticipated the growing impatience and reckoning with history, and oppressive governance systems that have since been exposed globally by young Africans, whether in the Black Lives Matter or End Sars movements.
Large-scale protests have taken place, statutes have toppled, and corrupt and brutal police have been stood up to. The movements are initiating a global conversation about slavery, colonialism, structural racism and the ways the lives of those of African descent globally have been marginalised, devalued and in extreme cases, even extinguished.
The Covid-19 pandemic that brought the planet to a stop has also enabled the flowering of this African Spring. It has increased understanding that what is being challenged is the unfair social contract that underpins the Atlantic civilisational space.
Like Arabs during their Spring, many people of African descent understand the commonalities and tropes of social, economic and legal oppressions spread across that civilisational space. They are now in the forefront of the calls for radical change, whether in unfair trade practices or capital flows between north or south (especially from their corrupt elites in Africa to the north), racism that produces unequal outcomes in health, education and justice systems, even in our own development sector, or at the apex of the UN institutions, with the Security Council, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Africa’s role in creating the Atlantic civilisational space
This space, unleashed by Columbus, has been the most important geopolitical reality of the last 500 years. The gold, land and free labour of the conquered and enslaved transformed the fortunes of the European world, turning small and medium countries into superpowers.
People of African descent have played critical roles in co-creating this civilisational space over the last 400 years, but rarely enjoyed the benefits. The protests are part of the reckoning by the black and African world of the damaging impact and legacies over the last 400 year of slavery and colonialism.
They reflect the mood for a radical and holistic reform and repair agenda in response, involving the 10 ‘Rs’: recognition of the crimes; remembrance of the victims; restoration of dignity; restitution of artefacts and human remains; reparations and compensation; reconnections with the severed African world; reconciliation between the continent and diaspora, return as achieved by groups like Rastas; reimagining the future, alongside reconstruction of African societies.
The 10 ‘Rs’ have frequently developed organisations and movements of their own but also quite often work as a continuum of one broader movement, seeking change and reform. These movements are likely to become more assertive, alongside Africa’s growing demographic importance.
It’s time for the marginalised to be seated at the table
Globally we are undergoing multiple resets:
- The health, economic and financial reset triggered by the pandemic; which is also accelerating a geopolitical reset with the relative decline of the Atlantic Space as the East rises;
- A technological reset
- The Black Lives Matter reset
- A Brexit reset for the UK, which might have implications for internal governance;
- A climate reset, that has consequences for us all.
Inclusive spaces are needed for dialogue as we renegotiate existing protocols and privileges. Unlike the silencing and criminalisation of Ogundele, the marginalised who are making fresh demands need to be seated at the table and have their voices heard.

 Did Germans Never Hear Directly or Indirectly Nigeria’s Demand for Return of Looted Artefacts? 
 
 “The restitution of those cultural objects which our museums and collections, directly or indirectly, possess thanks to the colonial system and are now being demanded, must also not be postponed with cheap arguments and tricks.” 
 Gert v. Paczensky and Herbert Ganslmayr,  Nofretete will nach Hause   (1) 
 In discussions on restitution of cultural objects to their countries of origin, we often hear very strange and abstruse arguments from the holders but I must confess I was not prepared for the explanation that came from the Berlin government in answer to a parliamentary question from the German Green Party, in the context of the discussions on the proposed project, Humboldt Forum. This project would involve transferring the ethnological objects, including the looted/stolen ones, from the Ethnologisches Museum, Dahlem, to the centre of Berlin in a new gigantic building now under construction.  (2) 
 The Berlin government of the ruling Social Democratic party declared: 
 “So far no demand for restitution from either the former Kingdom of Benin or the successor State Nigeria has either directly or indirectly been made to the Federal Government or to the Foundation Preussischer Kulturbesitz. ” . (3) 
 This astonishing and arrogant statement from the Berlin government is singular in its audacity and flies in the face of history and veracity. What it tries to do, rather boldly, is to deny all the discussions on the Benin artefacts since the notorious invasion of Benin in 1897 by the British and the demands of the peoples of the former Benin Kingdom under the leadership of the present Oba and the Government of Nigeria. We would not want to recount all the innumerable demands made by both the Oba of Benin and the various Nigerian governments. There have been in the last few years many meetings and discussions on the restitution of Benin bronzes in most of which German museum authorities participated, such as the recent meetings in Benin City on 19 th  and 29 th  February 2013 which issued the so-called  Benin Plan of Action on Restitution . (4)  The Ethnology Museum, Berlin and the Museum für Völkerkunde, Dresden, participated in this meeting. Are we to understand that the Berlin Government has not been informed directly or indirectly about such meetings and the demands of the Nigerians? 
 On the question of restitution of cultural artefacts, there has been an incredible play being acted over and over again. When Nigerians and other Africans ask for the return of their cultural objects, there is silence or denial. After a while, the holders declare that nobody has ever asked them to return the items. The Africans ask again and there is silence or further denial. How long will this play go on? The hypocrisy, lies and disrespect are beyond belief. Various international bodies such as the United Nations and UNESCO have recommended returning these objects but Western States and their museums seem not to pay any attention. They should not be surprised if other States follow their non-compliant practice in other areas. 
 BERLIN AUTHORITIES NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY APPROACHED BY OBA OF BENIN OR NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT 
 Whether the Berlin Government is aware or not, a Nigerian Minister of Culture went to Berlin in 2008 to carry the demands of the Nigerian peoples and Government in what was called  Berlin Plea for the return of Nigeria’s cultural objects.  (5)  How far must Nigerians carry their demand before the Berlin Government hears it, if bringing the message to Berlin it is still not enough to make it audible directly or indirectly, for the Berlin Government to notice? 
 At the opening of the exhibition  Benin: Kings and Rituals – Court Arts from Nigeria  in 2008 in Berlin, the then Nigerian Minister of Tourism, Culture and National Orientation, Prince Adetokumbo Kayode made a clear demand for the restitution of the Benin objects: 
 “ I wish to appeal to the conscience of all as the BERLIN PLEA OF RETURN OF NIGERIA’S CULTURAL OBJECTS that while Nigeria prepares itself and perhaps Africa prepares an official request for the return of its stolen artifacts, those hearts that are touched by that reckless act of colonization should on their own return all or part of the objects in their collection to Nigeria and Africa. It should not be seen as another declaration of war but a passionate plea” . (6) 
 Prince Adetokumbo Kayode explained further the significance of Berlin in this matter: 
 “ There is this coincidence of history in this great city by the presence of this exhibition. Berlin was the meeting place for the partitioning of Africa in 1884 (the scramble for Africa). It was here that the instrument of colonization was first hatched. African nations were then vulnerable and very week.  They were recovering from the ravages of the Slave Trade.  Africa had no voice in the partitioning of its land by the powerful countries of the time. It was an unbalanced equation in the theatre of war. The Berlin Conference led to and gave muscle to the plunder of African colonies and hence Benin Kingdom ”. 
 The Minister underlined the significant role of the looted Benin bronzes and the need for a healing process between the countries responsible for the loot or retention of the Benin bronzes and other African cultural objects, and the victims of these aggressions: 
 “ This exhibition presents the soul of our Nation, the pages of history that were torn away violently, the emblems and insignia of power and authority and the source of inspiration to our country.  I hope that this appeal shall be taken in good faith, in brotherhood, love for one another and in bridging gaps between the rich and powerful countries of the world and the weak. It is a way of reaching out to the once oppressed and wounded with the view that there can be a new healing process in the world where we live to share and play responsible roles. This process of voluntary return will go a long way to correct the ills of the past and heal the wounds of colonization ”. 
 But long before Prince Kayode, the great Ekpo Eyo and others had been trying to secure the return of  a few Benin bronzes and had sent messages to the embassies of all holders in Lagos: 
 “By the end of the 1960s, the price of Benin works had soared so high that the  Federal Government of Nigeria was in no mood to contemplate buying them.  When, therefore a National Museum was planned for Benin City in 1968, we  were faced with the problem of finding exhibits that would be shown to reflect  the position that Benin holds in the world of art history. A few unimportant  objects which were kept in the old local authority museum in Benin were  transferred to the new museum and a few more objects were brought in from  Lagos. Still the museum was ‘empty’. We tried using casts and photographs to  fill gaps but the desired effect was unachievable. We therefore thought of  making an appeal to the world for loans or return of some works so that Benin  might also be to show its own works at least to its own people. We tabled a draft  resolution at the General Assembly of the International Council of Museums  (ICOM) which met in France in 1968, appealing for donations of one or two  pieces from those museums which have large stocks of Benin works. The  resolution was modified to make it read like a general appeal for restitution or  return and then adopted.  When we returned to Nigeria, we circulated the adopted resolution to the  embassies and high commissions of countries we know to have large Benin  holdings but up till now we have received no reaction from any quarters and the  Benin Museum stays ‘empty’,”  (7) 
 Did the German embassy in Lagos not forward the note from Ekpo to the government in Berlin? We have known of secretaries throwing into wastepaper basket important documents in order to reduce the load of materials to be filed but would a German embassy act in this way? 
 The Nigerian Parliament asked President Obasanjo in 2002 to request the return of artefacts taken away during the colonial era  (8)  But would the government of a city that has been at the centre of many international disputes ever read or listen to what other governments were saying or for that matter what the media had been reporting? 
 The Oba of Benin sent his brother in 2000 to bring the request for the return of the Benin bronzes to the British Parliament which has become an important document in history and is known as Appendix 21. It is true that the document was addressed directly to the British as being primarily responsible for the Benin invasion and hence for the dispersal of the precious artefacts. But would the German government not hear about this and take notice of the intention and desire of the Oba of Benin?  (9) 
 If the Berlin authorities have not, directly or indirectly received the demand of the Nigerian, then they must look carefully into their system of communication of information. In the last few years, the demand for the return of the Benin bronzes has been repeated at every Benin exhibition and we can confirm that German museums and other institutions were well represented. 
 At the opening of the Benin exhibition   Benin:Kings And Rituals – Court Arts from Nigeria   on 8 May 2007, in the Museum für Völkerkunde, Vienna, the Benin Royal delegation made it absolutely clear in their statement that they wanted their art objects back in Benin. Prince G.I. Akenzua, Enogie of Evbuobanosa, brother of the Oba, elaborated further this demand during his lecture entitled, The Loss of Benin Artworks and their Original Function at the International Symposium which took place on 9th and 10th May 2007 in the Museum für Völkerkunde. There ensued a debate over restitution where Prof. C. Feest, then Director of the Völkerkunde Museum Vienna, repeated the usual western arguments against the restitution of the Benin artefacts. We promptly and unambiguously rejected the baseless arguments . (10) 
 But even before the opening of the exhibition, the Oba of Benin had expressed in an introductory note to the catalogue of the exhibition the desire of his people to have their artefacts back: 
 “ The exhibition is showcasing some of the works that made Benin (Nigeria) famous. It once again, reminds the world of a civilization truncated by the imperial forces of the colonialist. The works on show at this exhibition are some of the 3000 odd pieces of bronze and ivory works forcibly removed from my great grandfather’s palace by some Britons who invaded Benin in 1897. The British kept some of the loot for themselves and sold the rest to European and American buyers. These works now adorn public museums and private collector’s galleries, all over the world. “ 
 “We are pleased to participate in this exhibition. It links us, nostalgically, with our past. As you put this past on show today, it is our prayer that the people and government of Austria will show humaneness and magnanimity and return to us some of these objects which found their way to your country.”  (11) 
 The modest request of the Oba of Benin to have back some of the looted artefacts was promptly rejected in an arrogant and Eurocentric perspective in the preface of the same catalogue by the directors of the museums that organized the exhibition with Nigeria .  The Preface was signed by Prof. Christian Feest, Director, Museum für Völkerkunde Wien, Jean-Pierre Mohen, Director, patrimoine et collections, musée du quai Branly, Paris, Dr.Viola Koenig, Director, Ethnologisches Museum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin and James Cuno, President and Eloise W.Martin Director, The Art Institute of Chicago.   
 It is clear from the rejection by the museum directors that the demand by the Oba was directed to all the Western holders of the looted bronzes and not only Austria. How come then that the authorities in Berlin can now in 2013 declare they have not been directly or indirectly approached by the Oba or the Nigerian authorities? 
 The Director-General of the National Commission of Museums and Monuments, Yusuf Abdallah Usman has multiplied recently the request for the return of Nigerian artefacts from abroad: 
 “For the avoidance of doubt, we hereby place it on record that we demand, as we have always done, the return of these looted artworks and all stolen, removed or looted artefacts from Nigeria under whatever guise”.  (12) 
 We submit that the request by the Oba of Benin for the return of some of the looted Benin bronzes in the catalogue of the exhibition constitutes a direct request to the German museums and the German government represented at the opening of the exhibition and to those who were not there. The demand made at the symposium by the brother of the Oba is also to be considered as a direct request   to all holders of  Benin bronzes. The disrespect of a reigning monarch by Western museums and governments cannot be accepted as sufficient for declaring such requests, made in writing or to the hearing of representatives and scholars, as non-existent and  should not be allowed to negate such clear and direct expressions of will. 
 The declaration by the Berlin authorities that they have not been directly or indirectly approached with a demand for restitution by the Oba of Benin or the Nigerian government is based on a basic assumption that a person or entity that has lost property must submit a request to the holder of the property. In other words that in the absence of such a request the Germans cannot return the Benin bronzes. 
 Readers will no doubt be well aware of the farcical games played with the Egyptians regarding the demand of the restitution of Nefertiti.  (13) 
 But is there such a rule under International Law or Municipal Law that would prevent the Germans and other Western States from returning the Benin artefacts in the absence of a demand?  (14) 
 The United Nations General Assembly has since 1972 requested Member States in several resolutions to return cultural objects which were taken away during the colonial days .  The restitution of cultural objects to the countries of origin has become a permanent agenda item. In its resolution entitled   “ Return or restitution of cultural property to its country of origin” of 4 December 2006, (A/RES/61/52 ,)   the General Assembly reiterated the importance of restitution to these countries and called on all bodies of the United Nations and UNESCO as well as Member States ‘to continue to address the issue of return or restitution of cultural property to the countries of origin and to provide appropriate support accordingly’ . (15)  All these resolutions have not moved any of the western countries that hold illegal or stolen cultural objects. 
 Several international conferences have also urged the return of artefacts. For example, the UNESCO International Conference, The Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin, Athens, 17-18 March, 2008 urged museums to initiate dialogues on the return of important cultural property to the country and community of origin. ( 16 ) 
 Clearly, the refusal to return stolen cultural property violates the right to culture and right of access to culture as provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (I966) and the International Covenant on Civic and Political Rights (1966) in so far as the deprivation of a whole people or community of its cultural objects renders it impossible for the individuals in that community to exercise rights guaranteed under the international instruments. Indeed some acts of refusal to return cultural objects, such as crosses or other religious symbols must be considered as violations of religious freedom. The religious and ritual objects of the Edo are necessary if they are to follow their tradition and religion. It is remarkable that some States that pride themselves of their religion as part of their culture and even require immigrants to adopt  these values do not seem worried by the thought that they are preventing others from following and cultivating their traditional and religious values. 
 Western museums have not been enthusiastic to help in repatriating looted artefacts such as the Benin bronzes because of their complicity with colonial interventions and looting, Ana Filipa Vrdoljak has rightly declared: 
 “The history of museums shows that these institutions have facilitated, justified and benefited from colonialism and related policies of discrimination, assimilation and genocide. They have also often served to inform and engage broader societal concerns. The present-day ‘commitment to righten historic wrongs’ by former metropolitan powers and their museums must include restitution claims of indigenous and other colonised peoples. Museums must be actively involved in reversing and ameliorating the ongoing effects of these policies and practices”. ( 17 ) 
 The Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970 ) considers in its preamble that “ cultural property constitutes one of the basic elements of civilization and national culture, and that its true value can be appreciated only in relation to the fullest possible information regarding its origin, history and traditional setting” and states that “as cultural institutions, museums, libraries and archives should ensure that their collections are built up in accordance with universally recognized moral principles ”. ( 18) 
 The ICOM (International Council of Museums) Code of Ethics for Museums, 2006, which sets minimum standards for museums and their staff, provides as follows, regarding return of cultural property: 
 6.1   Co-operation 
 Museums should promote the sharing of knowledge, documentation and collections with museums and cultural organisations in the countries and communities of origin. The possibility of developing partnerships with museums in countries or areas that have lost a significant part of their heritage should be explored . 
 6.2 Return of Cultural property 
 Museums should be prepared to initiate dialogues for the return of cultural property to a country or people of origin. This should be undertaken in an impartial manner, based on scientific, professional and humanitarian principles as well as applicable local, national and international legislation, in preference to action at a governmental or political level. 
 6.3 Restitution of Cultural property 
 When a country or people of origin seeks the restitution of an object or specimen that can be demonstrated to have been exported or otherwise transferred in violation of the principles of international and national conventions, and shown to be part of that country’s or people’s cultural or natural heritage, the museum concerned should, if legally free to do so, take prompt and responsible steps to cooperate in its return .  (19)   
 In view of the above, it is our considered opinion that the lack of a formal/official request is no ground for the holding State and its institutions for not initiating a process of restitution or for refusing to return stolen cultural property. On the contrary there is a positive duty on museums holding looted/stolen/seized cultural items to start discussing their return, whether there is a formal/official request or not. 
 Therefore, the declaration that the Berlin authorities have not been approached directly or indirectly by either the Oba of Benin or the Nigerian authorities, cannot be accepted as an excuse for not returning or discussing the return of the cultural objects to the Oba of Benin. 
 Notwithstanding the above observations, we have suggested that Nigerian authorities write directly to museums with large collections of Benin artefacts in order to prevent the holders of looted artefacts from saying that there has not been any demand, an easy but unconvincing argument. The argument demonstrates beyond all reasonable doubt the unwillingness of the holder to envisage restitution. This position strengthens the determination of the holder not to consider the issue of restitution on its merits by blocking the demand at its very first step. 
 The Oba of Benin sent in 2009 letters hand-carried to the board of trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago and to the Field Museum,Chicago, requesting restitution of some Benin artefacts. Until today, there has not even been an acknowledgement of receipt from both institutions. Such is the conduct of those allegedly promoting understanding between different cultures of the world. 
 “LEGAL ACQUISITION” OF BENIN BRONZES BY GERMANY 
 The statement by the Berlin authorities takes a well-known second line of defence that argues that Germany acquired the Benin bronzes legally and therefore has no obligation to return them to the Oba of Benin. 
 There is no need here to recount the full story of the notorious bloody invasion of Benin in 1897 by the British army and the subsequent looting of the cultural artefacts . (20) 
 In answer to the question whether the Government considered as legal and legitimate the many Benin bronzes that the British looted in their invasion of Benin in 1897 and are now in the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin, which the Benin people are seeking to recover ,  the government answered as follows 
 “ A greater part of the 507 objects that constitute the Benin-Collection of the Ethnologisches Museum was acquired between 1897 and 1925 from the art market in London, and partly in Lagos. The Government and the  Foundation Preussischer Kulturbesitz are of the view that these objects were legally acquired and that there is no  International Law basis for demands for restitution ”(21) 
 As we have already discussed above the government stated that there had been no demands for restitution from the Oba or the Nigerian authorities. 
 The assertion that the Germans acquired legally the Benin bronzes that had been looted by the British in their notorious invasion of Benin in 1897 must not be accepted without discussion as to the alleged “legality”. As has been correctly stated above, the British sold the looted artefacts in London, on open market. The Germans were very enthusiastic purchasers of the Benin bronzes and indeed it was the German acquisition of various objects that prompted British institutions to increase their own stock . (22)  The then director of the Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, Felix von Luschan had been one of the first to recognize the excellent workmanship that had gone to produce those artefacts .(23)  Luschan had even advocated the use of force in acquiring cultural objects from peoples the European ethnologists considered to be condemned to disappear from the face of the earth. This racist conception which existed in German intellectual tradition and was present in the atrocities in Namibia continued its trajectory under Nazi rule in Germany and elsewhere . 
 With racist theories of European superiority and doubts whether Africans were human beings with intelligence, the British invasion of Benin was certainly not regretted by people like von Luschan and even long after his time, one seldom hears any expressions of regret by Europeans regarding the killings of thousands of Benin people (Edo). This is in contrast to regrets and apologies rendered in the case of victims of Nazi atrocities and aggressions. 
 Austrians, Germans and others who obtained Benin Bronzes from the British must be considered as not having any valid title to the artefacts they hold. In any case, the law of Benin never authorized the seizure of the Oba’s property. Benin being the place of the pretended acquisition by the British, the law of Benin 
 should govern the act of acquisition. Many have discussed this issue as if there were no laws in Benin in 1897 that would forbid such patent violation of rights in property. Joseph Egharevba, leading authority on Benin history and laws, states in his classic work,  The Benin Laws and Customs  (1947) that the person of the Oba is sacred and his property cannot be touched without his consent. He is the source of law and could make and repeal laws. The British of course were not interested in presenting a true picture of Benin society but preferred to depict the kingdom as a land of juju, cannibalism and human sacrifice. But what about others who have discussed this issue? How can they assume implicitly that Benin Law was not relevant, unless they were only concerned with power? But power is not law. 
 Legality of German purchases of Benin objects presupposes the legality of the British acquisition of the looted objects. The British looted the artefacts during their notorious invasion of Benin City. Does looting of property of others confer legality on the looter? Clearly, no legal system would accept the transfer of proprietary rights in this violent manner. There may be de facto acceptance of this illegality but does the fact that no one can push the looter to return the looted goods confer legality on the violent looter? Some have argued that the law in 1897 authorised a conqueror to take all the cultural artefacts of the defeated. But those arguing this way do not specify which law. Is it English Law, European International Law, from which Africans were excluded, or Benin Law? 
 After the devastating lootings of Napoleon and his troops in 1815 European International Law clearly regarded looting of cultural artefacts as illegitimate. Vrdoljak has stated: 
 “ By mid-1815, there was broad agreement that the French confiscations of cultural objects were contrary to contemporary rules of law and that objects could not remain in Parisian collections.”  (24) 
 Again we have the view expressed by Andy Ho that it was the Congress of Vienna (1815), held after the defeat of France at Waterloo, that settled the illegality of looting works of art in wartime: 
 “ The peace treaty explicitly required France to return a very wide range of cultural property to European countries from which they had been looted . 
 Clearly, then in 1860, when the Anglo-French force invaded Beijing, it had no legal rights under prevailing international law to the antiquities it took ”.  (25) 
 Prof, Neil Brodie has written : 
 “It should be recognized internationally that the Benin artworks were taken forcibly by an imperial power and, following the precedents of 1815 and 
 1945, that they should be returned. Ownership should be vested with an appropriate authority in Nigeria ”. (26) 
 Whatever may have been the legal position in European International Law, it was clearly not part of African International Law that conquerors could take away the cultural objects of a defeated nation.  In any case, Africans were not considered to be part of European International Law and any rules and practices developed in this respect clearly did not apply to Benin’s cultural objects. Incidentally, there is not one single example of a victorious African army stealing the cultural objects of the defeated and proudly displaying in its country. 
 Benin law would not have authorized the looting of the Oba’s property since his person is regarded as untouchable and all the property under his care is also protected. The British looting of the Benin bronzes was from a legal point of view illegal and illegitimate. It follows from the above that the looters, the British, could not transfer any proprietary rights to the Germans. They may have paid cash but the objects they allegedly bought were tainted with illegality  ab initio . Moreover, the Germans knew very well that the objects they were buying were illegally transferred from Benin City to London. They bought the Benin Bronzes, from a notorious British auctioneer, W.D.Webster who also sold Benin artefacts to Austrians. Indeed the first auction took place a few months after the invasion, in May 1897. Many of the objects the Germans and Austrians bought must have had some of the blood of the people of Benin on them, fresh from the battlefield. Is that what the Berlin government regards as legal acquisition? 
 The legality of the British “acquisition” by violence, by invading an African country, thousands of miles from Europe, has never been considered by an impartial judiciary system but most honest people will regard such violent action as illegal. Moreover, the Germans who allegedly bought the artefacts from the British could not have legitimately acquired valid rights for lack of  bona fides,  good faith, “guten Glauben”. In any case, the Germans cannot completely distance or disassociate themselves from the criminal invasion of Benin in 1897. After all, it was the attempt by the British to enforce the division of areas of control or influence which the Germans and the British, with others, had set up in 1885 in Berlin that led to the conflict between the British and Oba Ovonramvem who resisted British attempts to exercise control over Benin. The conflict that eventually led to the looting of the Benin artefacts cannot be seen as a remote consequence of the Berlin Conference but must be accepted as a direct result of that division of areas of control by the Europeans. At the time of the 1885 conference, Africa and the areas the Europeans allocated to themselves were known to be inhabited and it was clear to all that conflicts would ensue. 
 Contracts of purchase between the Ethnologisches Museum and British dealers should not be treated like ordinary contracts between German tourists and English shopkeepers in Regents Street. The historical context must be seriously considered to give the act of purchase its full significance and meaning . 
 
 MEETINGS ON “RESTITUTION” OF THE BENIN BRONZES. 
 In answer to the question what meetings had been held with the owners of the Benin bronzes, the Berlin government answered as follows: 
 “Since 2010 there have been regular meetings between representatives of the King of Benin, the National Commission of Museums and Monuments in Nigeria and various European museums with large Benin collections (London, Vienna, Leiden, Stockholm and Dresden) on the question of treatment of objects from the Kingdom of Benin. The agreed aim of all participants is in the long term to find a possibility to present in Nigeria objects from the Benin collections in Europe. At present, the main emphasis is on the work of documentation of Benin collections in Europe to be placed on the internet as well as the intensification of the cooperation between all the participating museums and institutions ”. (27) 
 Many will be surprised by the statement that the various meetings held since 2010 between the representatives of the Oba of Benin, the National Commission of Museums and Monuments and representatives of European museums at London, Vienna, and Leiden. Stockholm and Dresden, holders of large collections of Benin artefacts, were about documentation of the artefacts; a documentation that would also be placed in the internet and an eventual display of some of the artefacts in Nigeria. Up to now, many had the understanding and the impression that these meetings were about the restitution of at least some of the looted Benin bronzes. Newspaper reports as well as statements from the National Commission had led to the belief that some progress had been made in the direction of restitution . (28) 
 The explanations of the recent meetings as given by the Berlin government correspond essentially to what happened in the meeting in Benin City. Though the document issued at the end of that meeting was entitled The Benin Plan of Action on Restitution, there was nothing in it that envisaged restitution of the precious Benin artefacts. No wonder that the representative of the Oba declared he would not take part any more in such meetings in future. Besides, the British Museum did not take part in the meeting . (29) 
 
 HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS, POLITICAL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 
 The Berlin government expressed in its response its conviction that the ICOM Code of Ethics forms the basis of the work of the museums in Berlin and that they are aware of their historical and political responsibility in the treatment of acquisitions from the colonial period.  (30) 
 To state that the vast majority of the acquisitions in the Benin collection were made between 1897 and 1925 and then declare that ICOM rules adopted in 1986 form the basis of the work of the museum requires some explanation in order to be convincing. Certainly, the Ethnologisches Museum has not been following the ICOM rules as far as they relate to restitution. As for the important acquisitions of Benin artefacts, they were made before the ICOM Code of Ethics was established. One cannot help feeling that the name of ICOM was thrown into the statement by the Berlin government to secure for the museums a veneer of legitimacy and legality. The statement seeks to create an aura of rectitude around the museum in order to avert criticisms especially from the youth. 
 If the Berlin museums were really conscious of their historical and political responsibility as regards artefacts acquired in the colonial era, they would not want to be seen arguing with Africans about the return of cultural artefacts that are undoubtedly African. 
 The cruelty and unbelievable oppression in German colonies require no elaboration here .  ( 31 ) It was in an atmosphere of excessive oppression that many artefacts were collected from the German colonies. When it is said that many artefacts were given to the museums as gifts by German travellers, it should be remembered that these were objects extracted from Africans who had no choice but to hand over to the Europeans whatever they wanted. In a study entitled “The Position of Africans in the German Colonies’”, Helmut Stoecker declared; 
 “ The almost total absence of genuine liberalism among the Germans in the colonies, the grim and obstinate anti-African racism already referred to, and the preference for direct and openly practiced oppression all combined to make a situation possible in which ‘nearly every white man walks around with a whip and almost every white man indulges in striking any black man he chooses to, as Colonial Secretary Bernhard Dernburg discovered in Dar es Salaam in 1907.”  (32) 
 Cornelia Essner has written the following : 
 “ That the acquisition of ethnografica in the colonial time was on the basis of more or less “structural violence” will not be pursued in detail in this context. Some individual contemporaries were perfectly aware of this fact. Thus one Africa traveller and resident in the German Empire in Ruanda, Richard Kandt, wrote in 1897 to Felix von Luschan, Deputy Director of the Ethnology Museum, Berlin, as follows; “It is especially difficult to procure an object without at least employing some force. I believe that half of your museum consists of stolen objects .” (33) 
 We all recollect that Berlin was the place where the imperialist powers of Europe met in 1885 and divided Africa among themselves and thus set in motion a system of government that brought untold suffering on the African peoples. We need only remember Namibia, formerly German colony of South West Africa where the cruelty of German colonial rule exceeded all bounds and stamped Germany with a terrible reputation only surpassed by Nazi Germany. The effects of the oppressive German regime are still felt in Namibia where recently the human remains of those Namibians massacred and brought to Germany have been returned after arduous negotiations. Germany still refuses to apologize or pay compensation . (34) 
 Given the background of German colonial experience in the collection of artefacts in Africa and the pre-eminent role of the Ethnologisches Museum in this matter and being fully aware of the history of the acquisition of the Benin Bronzes, a Berlin government and its museums should be adopting a different position from what is conveyed by the response to the Green Party. They should be interested in returning at least some of the looted artefacts and seek a reasonable compromise. They would in any case seek to avoid endless discussions on such an issue and endeavour to prevent any impression of continuity in the present and past German practice and ideology with regard to collecting cultural artefacts of others. But can one achieve this and still maintain the loot of the past, albeit via the British? 
 From the 507 Benin artefacts that the Berlin regime mentioned (although by some counts there should be more, about 580) some 307 for example, could be returned to Benin City; arrangements could be made for lending some of the remaining objects if the Nigerians request. From the answer of the Berlin government, there is no trace of a sense of historical responsibility and moral consciousness. The government is out of tune with the spirit of our times which is to return artefacts wrongly taken away from colonial and other oppressed peoples. Magnus Magnusson has rightly stated: 
 “ The German language has the word for it: Zeitgeist. The Zeitgeist, literally, „time spirit“, the attitude or general outlook of a specific time or age; The Zeitgeist of the early twenty-first century where restitution and redemption is concerned is so much more humane than that of the twentieth century”.  ( 35) 
 The language and stance of the Berlin government appears to be the same as other responses by Western governments to former colonial States and their peoples. The ton and response of the Berlin government correspond to the tenets of the now discredited Declaration on the Importance and Value of  Universal Museums (DIVUM) in so far as the German authorities refuse to envisage the return of any of the Benin bronzes to the people of Benin .  They are willing to assist the Nigerians in cataloguing the Benin Bronzes; they are willing to put this catalogue on the internet. What they are not willing to do is to consider the return of any of the 507 objects. German authorities subscribe to the false notion in the discredited Declaration on the Value and Importance of Universal Museum that: 
 “Over time, objects so acquired – whether by purchase, gift, or partage – have become part of the museums that have cared for them, and by extension part of the heritage of the nations which house them. Today we are especially sensitive to the subject of a work’s original context, but we should not lose sight of the fact that museums too provide a valid and valuable   context for objects that were long ago displaced from their original source”   (36) 
 What the Berlin government is saying is that they are not prepared to loosen or give up the political and cultural hegemony that, in line with other Western States, they have established over Africa and Africans. Much of this domination is 500 years old and forms part of a mechanism that allows the West to dictate to Africa in all domains, including culture. These Benin bronzes are largely records and symbols of power and to return them would imply that the West has finally accepted Africans as capable of looking after themselves and not in need of any outside control. Such a concession has never been considered by the West which maintains supremacy even in matters of African art .There are by far better and more African art icons in Europe than in Africa itself. Those, including Africans, who want to study African art, need to go to Europe, to places such as the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin, to see the African icons. The West is not yet ready to return to Africa the symbols of power seized in colonial and imperialist wars. The West remains symbolically and factually the master of Africa and its destiny. This is the affirmation implicit in the refusal to hear demands for restitution or to consider the possibility of returning any Benin bronze. 
 If the Berlin museum were operating on the basis of the ICOM Code of Ethics, they would have taken the initiative to meet with representatives of the Oba to discuss the return of the Benin Bronzes as required by rules 6.2 and 6.3 of the Code. They would not be seen as disputing ownership of the artefacts and definitely would not be denying, contrary to all evidence that they ever heard of a desire by the people of Benin to have their artefacts back. This is clearly unworthy of Germany. 
 Most young Germans are surprised to hear that their government is in dispute with Nigerians over the ownership of the Benin Bronzes. They are revolted to learn that some 507 or more pieces are in Berlin alone and that the German authorities are not willing to return even a single object. Somebody will have to explain the discrepancy in the number of Benin artefacts in the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin . (37)  The youth wonder what those African pieces have to do with German culture. They cannot understand how their government can boast with African artefacts and wonder whether German culture does not have enough to show. Decorating yourself with the feathers of others seems very objectionable, especially when those feathers have been stolen. 
 The youth realize in this matter that the commandment “Thou shall not steal” does not seem to be applied by their own authorities as far as cultural artefacts are concerned. 
 What will Nigerian authorities and the public make out of the statement from Berlin that Nigerian representatives have not brought to the attention of the Germans the demand for the restitution of the Benin bronzes looted in 1897? 
 What is sure is that the people of Benin and Nigeria cannot accept that by putting information about the looted artefacts on internet or cataloguing them, they lose their right to recover the precious artefacts that are now decorating Western museums which are supposedly cooperating with Nigeria. Records and symbols of Benin civilization belong to Benin and should be returned without any further excuses.

 “Efforts at dialoguing have brought about recent interface with most of the major museums in Europe. The Commission instigated discussions on modalities of returning Benin objects to Nigeria. This has resulted in the meeting of the major museums in Europe and the Commission in Vienna, Austria and Berlin, Germany in 2010 and 2011 respectively. A third meeting is scheduled for Benin City before the end of this year. The heads of these European museums have signified their intention to attend this meeting. It will be recalled that Nigeria was one of the strong voices in the Egyptian Conference of 2010 where return of the pieces of each countries priceless antiquities were demanded to be returned to their countries of origin.”

 “They were stolen over 116 years ago and taken to Europe. These over 3,000 pieces of bronze were looted from the old Benin Empire during the 1897 British Punitive Expedition. Today, these priceless bronze works are trapped behind glass walls in European galleries and museums. Hope for their return rose last week as some representatives of European museums met with their Nigerian counterparts and officials of the Benin Royal palace on the issue.

 20. There is a vast amount of literature on the notorious British invasion of Benin in 1097. I mention here just a few. 
 Ekpo Eyo, “Benin: The sack that was”.  http://www.dawodu.net/eyo.htm  ,”The 
 Dialectics of Definitions: “Massacre” and “Sack” in the History of the Punitive 
 Expedition”, African  Arts,  1997, Vol. XXX, No.3, pp. 34-35. 
 Wikipedia, “Benin Expedition of 1897”  http://www.dawodu.net/eyo.htm 
 K. Opoku, “Benin to Berlin Ethnologisches Museum: Are Benin Bronzes Made in Berlin?”  http://www.museum-security.org 
 Frank Willet, “Benin” in  Afrika: Kunst und Kultur  (ed.) Hans-Joachim Koloss, Prestel Verlag, Munich, 1999 p. 43 states that Phillips and his troops had peaceful intentions, and that the guns they had with them had been packed away and not ready for usage. 
 The story of Benin has been told several times but I have always found the short account by Sylvester Okwunodu Ogbechie very useful: 
 “In February 1897, an elite British force of about 1200 men (supported by several hundred African auxiliary troops and thousands of African porters) besieged Benin City, capital of the Edo Kingdom of Benin, whose ruler, the Oba Ovonramwen sat on a throne that was a thousand years old. The British Punitive Expedition used Maxim machine guns to mow down most of the Oba’s 130,000 soldiers and secure control of the capital city. They set fire to the city and looted the palace of 500 years worth of bronze objects that constituted the royal archive of Benin’s history, an irreplaceable national treasure. The king and his principal chiefs fled into the countryside, pursued by British forces who lay waste to the countryside as a strategy to force the people of Benin to give up their fugitive king. According to Richard Gott,  for a further six months, a small British force harried the countryside in search of the Oba and his chiefs who had fled. Cattle was seized and villages destroyed. Not until August was the Oba cornered and brought back to his ruined city. An immense throng was assembled to witness the ritual humiliation that the British imposed on their subject peoples. The Oba was required to kneel down in front of the British military “resident” the town and to literally bite the dust. Supported by two chiefs, the king made obeisance three times, rubbing his forehead on the ground three times. He was told that he had been deposed .  Oba Ovonramwen  finally surrendered to stem the slaughter of his people. Many of his soldiers considered his surrender an unbearable catastrophe and committed suicide rather than see the king humiliated. A significant number, led by some chiefs, maintained guerrilla warfare against the British for almost two years until their leaders were captured and executed. The remaining arms of the resistance thereafter gave up their arms and merged back into the general population.”

Gemeinsam vereinbartes Ziel aller Beteiligten ist es, langfristig eine Möglichkeit zu finden, Objekte aus europäischen Benin-Sammlungen in Nigeria zu präsentieren. Zurzeit liegt der Schwerpunkt der Arbeit auf der Dokumentation von Benin-Sammlungen in Europa, der Bereitstellung dieser Dokumentation im Internet sowie der Intensivierung der Zusammenarbeit aller beteiligten Museen und Institutionen .“

 The Guardian Nigeria, 15.2.2013 
 Nigerian Tribune,  Stolen Benin  artefacts :  Hope  of retrieval beckons –  Nigerian  Tribune 
 “The Benin National Congress recently picked up the struggle from where previous groups had stopped. BNC argued that the Federal Government was not doing enough, saying that a proactive government would strive to use every diplomatic and international legal means to redress the injustices done to its federating units. The group called on President Goodluck Jonathan to constitute a high-powered committee to prosecute the task of repatriating all looted Benin artefacts. So, when the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), led by its Director General, Mr Yusuf Abdallah Usman, last month visited Benin on the same mission, there was indeed hope that perhaps the long lost treasures would return home one day .”

 33.  „Dass der Erwerb von Ethnographica in der Kolonialzeit auf der Grundlage mehr oder minder ‘struktureller Gewalt’ erfolgte, soll hier in diesem Rahmen nicht näher verfolgt werden. Einzelnen Zeitgenossen war diese Tatsache im Übrigen durchaus bewußt. So schrieb der Afrikareisende und Resident des Deutschen Reiches in Ruanda, Richard Kandt, 1897 an Felix von Luschan, den stellvertretenden Direktor des Berliner Völkerkunde-Museums: Überhaupt ist es schwer, einen Gegenstand zu erhalten, ohne zum mindesten etwas Gewalt anzuwenden.

 37. I reproduce below, a note I made on the issue of how many Benin artefacts the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin has from my article, “Benin to Berlin Ethnologisches Museum: Are Benin Bronzes Made in Berlin?”,  http://www.modernghana.com 
 The discrepancies in numbers, between 507 the Berlin government states and the 580 which Luschan and others give, require explanation from the Museum. We know of course that the British sold some of the looted Bronzes not only in 1897 but in fairly recent times. See Martin Bailey, “BBC Sold Benin Bronzes”  www.forbes.com   Did the Germans also sell some Benin Bronzes? What happened to the Benin artefacts in the museums of the former DD (German Democratic Republic)? 
 Barbara Plankensteiner states in her latest book  Benin,  5 Continents Editions, 2010, p48,  “ Felix von Luschan, the curator at Berlin’s Museum für Völkerkunde, played a major role, encouraging his colleagues to collect, and he himself amassing the largest collection in the world, consisting of some more than 550 pieces.” 
 “Paula Ivanov, ‘African Art in the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin’, African Arts, Vol.33, No.3, p.21. Ivanov mentions in this article, that the Ethnologisches Museum, Berlin has 482 Benin objects (p21) but P.Roese in his article, ‘Felix von Luschan (1854-1924) und Benin – Hans Grimm gewidmet’, (Tribus, Vol.48, 1999, pp.173-182) states that Felix von Luschan secured for the Museum 580 pieces. Anja Laukötter, in herexcellent book, Von der ‘Kultur’ zur ‘Rasse’ – vom Objekt zum Körper : Völkerkundemuseen und ihre Wissenschaft zu Beginn des 20.Jahhunderts (Transcript Verlag, Bielefeld, 2007,P160), cites Luschan as follows: 
 ‘Im ganzen sind rund 2400 Benin Stűcke zu meiner Kenntnis gelangt: davon sind 580 in Berlin, 280 im Brit.Museum, 227 in Rushmore (die von Pitt Rivers hinterlassene Sammlung), 196 in Hamburg,182 in Dresden, 167 in Wien, 98 in Leiden, 87 in Leipzig, 80 in Stuttgart, 76 in Cőln und 51 in Franfurt a .M.’ 
 What explains this difference of some 73 pieces? Perhaps the Ethnologisches Museum kept the best 503 and distributed the remaining 73 to the other German museums? 
 In this connection, it may be useful to look at the very interesting study by Charlotta Dohlvik, Museums and their Voices: a Contemporary Study of the Benin Bronzes, Master’s Dissertation, May 2006, Göteborg University. Dohlvik states that ‘the largest collection of Benin items are found at the Ethnological Museum in Berlin’. The author also found out that the ‘collections of Benin heads are strongly concentrated in museums of Western Europe and the United States’ and that ‘The often-heard statement about the collection of Benin material being dispersed all over the world is thus a point of description that should be expressed with some moderation. p.29” 
 See also Gisela Völger, Curator, Trader, Benin Scholar – Felix von Luschan -An Austrian in Royal-Prussian Museum Service, in  Benin Kings and Rituals  (Ed.) Plankensteiner ,pp. 213-225. Völger gives the following distribution figures for the 2400 objects said to have reached Europe: 
  In Germany: Berlin 580, Hamburg 196, Dresden 182, Leipzig 87, Stuttgart 80, Cologne 73, Munich, Braunschweig, Mannheim, Freiburg and others in Germany not more than 95 items. 
  Outside Germany: British Museum 280, Pitt Rivers Museum (Oxford) and Pitt Rivers country residence, Rushmore in Farnham/Dorset 327, Various members of the Punitive Expedition of 1897 300, Leiden 98, Chicago 33, St. Petersburg 40, Vienna 167. 
  Laukötter, gives the following distribution, following Luschan: of the 2400 objects that left Benin: 580 in Berlin, 280 in British Museum, 227 in Rushmore, the Pitt Rivers Collection, 196 in Hamburg, 182 in Dresden,167 in Vienna, 98 in Leiden, 87 in Leipzig, 80 in Stuttgart, 76 in Cologne, and 51 in Frankfurt am Main. Laukötter, op. cit. p.160.“

113,"In Germany, the Humboldt Forum stirs up a colonial controversy",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/germany-humboldt-forum-stirs-colonial-controversy,"In Germany, a new museum stirs up a colonial controversy
Berlin's Humboldt Forum is reigniting debate over who has the right to own and display Africa's heritage.
For years, the head of a queen sat in storage in a building in Berlin. Her face is smooth, but her head is intricately engraved and topped with a crown befitting a lyoba—a matriarch figure from the Kingdom of Benin, in present day Nigeria.
Carved in the early 16th century, it is one of more than a thousand metal sculptures looted by British soldiers as they plundered Benin City in 1897. In the century since, the so-called Benin Bronzes have been bought and sold by museums and private collectors across Europe and North America, and today they are among the most coveted African artifacts in the world.
All of which poses a major problem for Europe’s newest museum. Twenty years in the making, Germany’s Humboldt Forum opens its doors digitally this week—and intends to open physically next spring—to display thousands of artifacts from Africa, Asia, and beyond. Berlin’s Ethnological Museum, from whose collection the Forum will heavily draw, currently controls some 530 Bronzes and other Benin artifacts—the second largest such collection in the world, after the British Museum. Half of the Benin collection will go on display in the Forum.
Late last week, just days before the Forum’s inauguration, Nigeria’s ambassador to Germany wrote a letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanding Germany send its Benin Bronzes back, reigniting a controversy over who should have the right to own, curate, and display African heritage to the world.
Across Europe, activists are demanding the return of hundreds of thousands of African artifacts that were stolen or purchased during colonial times. “When we talk about restitution, we don’t mean emptying European or American museums of their collections,” says George Abungu, former Director General of the National Museums of Kenya and an advisor to the Humboldt Forum. “The question of restitution is not about returning everything, but [rather] things that have meaning—symbolic significance, ritual meanings—that were taken away. These need to come back home.”
In 2017, President Emmanuel Macron of France, a nation that colonized large swaths of North and West Africa, declared that France would return the artifacts it stole. In 2018 Belgium, which colonized Congo, was rattled by protests calling for authorities to return some of the 180,000 African artifacts kept in the Royal Museum for Central Africa outside Brussels. The British Museum in London, which owns 69,000 artifacts from sub-Saharan Africa, has notoriously refused to give back or even loan out its improperly acquired African artifacts. (A new museum in Benin City, Nigeria, hopes to change that.)
Germany—having colonized Africa more briefly than other European powers—had so far weathered this storm relatively unnoticed. That is changing as the Humboldt Forum brings the country front and center in the restitution debate.
The Forum is located just a few streets from where, 136 years ago, Europe’s leaders convened in the personal residence of King Wilhelm I to carve Africa into pieces for the colonizers. The 1884-1885 Berlin Conference, also known as the Congo Conference, was a bid by Wilhelm and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to catch up with other colonial leaders in their race to profit from Africa’s natural resources, slaves, and craftsmanship.
That controversial history is particularly difficult to overlook on account of the building that Germany’s Bundestag chose to house the Forum: the Berlin Palace, the former Prussian palace where Wilhelm’s successor, Wilhelm II, lived off Africa’s riches.
The Humboldt Forum’s long-awaited and oft-delayed inauguration comes at the peak of a global pandemic. But a delay to its physical opening may be the least of its worries. Its creators are facing a vociferous debate over whether a European museum of African artifacts should even exist.
“We as Africans are asking—what do they want to show us by rebuilding this palace of the colonialists? Do they want to show us they are still the ones in power?” says Mnyaka Sururu Mboro, a Tanzanian living in Germany who opposed the Forum’s construction. “I have been in the basements in the Ethnological Museum here in Berlin. You find there are thousands and thousands of objects in there that were taken during colonial times. We Africans—we want them back.”
Breaking ground
First conceived in 2001, the Humboldt Forum is located in the heart of Berlin, next to the city’s other powerhouse institutions on Museum Island, the tourist mecca in the center of the Spree River. Its founders wanted Berlin to become one of the great museum cities of Europe, boasting a world-class institution comparable to the British Museum or the Louvre.
The Forum is named in honor of a pair of 18th century brothers who Germans remember with pride: the philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt, and his younger sibling, Alexander von Humboldt, a naturalist who collected specimens and artifacts from across the globe.
According to the museum’s website, “the Humboldt Forum is concerned with nothing less than the history and culture of the world in all its complexity.” It strives “to tell the universal story of the human race from multiple perspectives.”
The Forum will exhibit works from Berlin’s Asian Art Museum, Humboldt University, the Berlin City Museum, and the Ethnological Museum. Many of its artifacts came to Berlin through a “network of traders, collectors, colonial officers and civil servants,” the museum’s website states.
According to Paola Ivanov, who is curating part of the Humboldt Forum’s Africa collection, before the Berlin Conference propelled Germany into the race to conquer Africa, the Ethnological Museum possessed just 3,361 African objects. By the end of the colonial era, that number had soared to some 50,000. Some of those objects were plundered from what was then known as German East Africa during the German colonial period of 1886-1919.
Germany’s African territories included parts of present-day Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi in East Africa; Namibia in the south; and Cameroon and Togo in the west. In 2016, the Ethnological Museum established a framework “to research the provenance of problematic holdings,” specifically the more than 10,000 artifacts from Tanzania, some of which were obtained through “violent appropriation and colonial wars.” The museum also invited scientists from Tanzania to research artifacts in the collection, fostering a cross-continental exchange.
“We have very problematic objects in the Tanzania collection, because Germans conquered Tanzania in a very violent way,” Ivanov says. “The Maji Maji wars that Germans conducted in southern Tanzania caused the deaths of at least 200,000 people. A lot of objects are connected with these violent conquests.”
Ivanov says the museum has been conducting provenance research to understand how hundreds of these items came into German hands. For instance, her team of anthropologists traced a set of sculpted figures from Cameroon and a stool from Benin back to their origins. For the Humboldt Forum’s inaugural display, they surrounded these artifacts with historical files, photos, films, and other media selected with the help of African curators.
But to do the same for all of the museum’s 75,000 African artifacts would be a Herculean task. “Without this research, no Humboldt Forum or ethnological museum can be opened today,” said art historian Bénédicte Savoy, who served on the Humboldt Forum’s advisory board. She resigned in 2017 over what she said was the museum’s failure to critically investigate its collection. Each item in the collection ought to be thoroughly vetted before being put on display, Savoy says, so that the public knows “how much blood is dripping from a work of art.” (This forensic archaeologist has identified hundreds of stolen artifacts.)
Bronze beauties
Of all the African artifacts in European museums, none have garnered more attention than the Benin Bronzes—which, incidentally, are made of brass as well as bronze.
“They’ve become kind of the symbol for the whole restitution debate,” says Jörg Häntzschel, who writes about museums for the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. “They’re like the scars of all the objects in European museums, partly because they’re really valuable.” Some have sold at global art auctions for millions of dollars.
“These Benin objects are stunningly beautiful,” says Häntzschel, who has traveled to Cameroon to see African artifacts in their original homes. “And they’re also such a clear-cut case of looting—they were all looted within a few days by this British expedition.” Many were quickly sold off to wealthy collectors in Germany and Austria.
“The Germans knew very well that the objects they were buying were illegally transferred from Benin City to London,” writes Kwame Opoku, a journalist and author who advocates for the return of Africa’s artifactual heritage. Some of the bronzes were auctioned just months after their seizure. “Many of the objects the Germans and Austrians bought must have had some of the blood of the people of Benin on them, fresh from the battlefield,” Opoku writes. (Here's how the British took the Parthenon's marbles.)
Today, even nations that never held colonies in Africa are being pulled into the restitution debate. Descendants of Benin rulers have written letters to the Art Institute of Chicago and Chicago’s Field Museum requesting that their ancestors’ artifacts be returned. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York all own bronzes from Benin. “Those Benin Bronzes are scattered everywhere in the world,” says Abungu. “The moral obligation is on the people who took these things. You can’t run away from it.”
Some believe Germany has a unique responsibility to return its bronzes. After all, it was the Berlin Conference that accelerated the “scramble for Africa” and led to the looting of the bronzes and many other artifacts. Others say the Forum is an inherently racist institution and ought never to have been built. To display colonial treasure in a former imperialist palace harkens back to “times when ‘exotic curiosities’ were displayed in the ‘cabinets of wonders,’” according to No Humboldt 21, a group of activists who oppose the Forum.
Simon Rittmeier, co-founder of the International Inventories Programme, which seeks to catalogue Kenya’s artifacts abroad, explains that “the Ethnological Museum that we know started in the 1600s with this curiosity complex.” During the German empire, says Rittmeier, “the power for a king was in showing exotic objects and assembling them in one place as a sign of power. This European idea lingers. It’s still present today.”
A 'universal museum'
A former director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, coined the concept of the “universal museum” as a place where people from all cultures could come to admire and learn from the past. The Humboldt Forum was fashioned with that same vision, and MacGregor was hired to lead it, becoming one of its three founding directors. The Forum’s initial mission was “to be in touch with as much of the world as possible” and create a “Universal Museum for the 21st Century.”
But to those who oppose the Forum, that idea seems increasingly at odds with the reality, underscored by the tightening of Europe’s borders, that most Africans will never have the chance to experience Europe’s newest institution.
“If Africans are not let into European borders—some even die on their way—you can’t talk about a ‘universal museum,’” says Leonie Emeka, a Nigerian German and recent art history graduate who has conducted provenance research into the Humboldt Forum’s collection. Some African artists have even been denied visas to exhibit their own work in European countries, including Germany. “Not everyone in this world has access to this universal museum,” Emeka says.
According to Savoy, the new museum comes at the wrong time. “Germany is redefining itself as an international, open country,” she says. “It is making huge efforts to accept people from conflict and war zones. So to make a [colonial] museum in this place at this moment—they cannot.”
The first step toward restitution of African artifacts, says Savoy, is for European museums to catalog the objects they have. Germany’s Ethnology Museum owns some half a million artifacts, but the origins of many remain unknown. Last year, the philanthropist George Soros launched a $15-million initiative to support provenance research aimed at restituting African artwork.
Some activists have taken matters into their own hands. Mwazulu Diyabanza, who advocates for Europe to pay reparations to Africa for colonialism, has gone so far as to steal artifacts back from French museums, arguing that to steal something that was stolen is merely to return it to its rightful place. The act of stealing back African artifacts was popularized in a scene in Marvel’s hit 2018 superhero movie set in Africa, Blank Panther.
Museum curators counter that artifacts shouldn’t be returned to Africa until there are modern, climate-controlled museums and storage facilities there in which to house them. But last year, Häntzschel discovered that Berlin’s Ethnological Museum had been storing some of its own artifacts under terrible conditions. Its Berlin storage rooms would sometimes flood, leaving artifacts ankle-deep in water. He found similar substandard conditions in museums across Germany. One museum curator told Häntzschel that as many as 15 percent of all the artifacts in Germany have not even been counted. “There is total chaos in German ethnological museums,” she said.
Last year, a hundred academics signed an open letter demanding that Germany immediately open its African collections to researchers to examine whether they were appropriately obtained. Their call came the year after Germany’s culture minister outlined how German museums should research the provenance of their artifacts from abroad.
As for the Benin Bronzes, the Forum will devote two large rooms to the Benin exhibit that describe the 1,000-year history of the Kingdom of Benin, as well as the 1897 looting by British soldiers. And in 2018 Germany’s Ethnological Museum joined a handful of other European museums in announcing they would loan back some of the bronzes for the inauguration of a new museum in Nigeria. But others argue such objects should be returned outright.
To Häntzschel, the restitution debate is “not just a question of ownership. It’s a question of how do you deal with your past? It’s a question of what do you do with it?”
By putting African objects into showcases and declaring them art, says Rittmeier, we are “disconnecting them from their former use, disconnecting them from being touched, from being felt.” This “cuts the ties with its history.”
Rather than simply displaying African objects for museumgoers to gaze at, some have suggested rethinking the museum experience altogether. Instead of walking through exhibits, visitors might attend gallery tours and lectures about a particular collection led by curators who have made it their life’s work to understand their historical significance.
“I would do a completely different anthropological museum,” says Emeka, the young art history graduate. A museum, she says, should not be a static building, but a living thing. The 644 million euros spent on the Humboldt Forum, she suggests, might have been better spent flying anthropologists from Angola to Germany to curate presentations about Angolan artifacts, or traveling across Angola to reach out to communities who don’t have access to a “universal museum” in a country they cannot reach.",,2021-05-03,germany new museum stir colonial controversy berlin

114,The new Benin Royal Museum to see the temporary restitution ...,https://www.art-critique.com/en/2018/11/the-new-benin-royal-museum-to-see-the-temporary-restitution-of-art-and-artifacts/,"European museums have consistently been tied up in issues of repatriation of artworks looted and taken from their home countries throughout history. The British Museum is one such museum housing artifacts and artworks from various places that were taken during many years of British conquest and empire.
In an effort to bring artifacts home, Nigeria has recently release plans for a new Benin Royal Museum which will begin this process, temporarily at least. On 19 October, in the Dutch city of Leiden, museum officials from Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK agreed to lend Nigerian artworks and artifacts to their home country for three-year periods. These works will be part of a permanent display at the new museum.
The agreement, though it does not right the wrong of past generations and is not exactly repatriating the works, is certainly a nudge in the right direction as museums work to progress in this issue. The Benin Dialogue Group does not see the loans as an ‘endpoint in negotiations’ and Nigeria has not waived their claims to ownership. However, Prince Gregory Akenzua (Engoie of Evbobanosa) of the Benin royal family stated that he is ‘happy that we are making progress in the effort to give our people the opportunity to once more access our heritage that was looted.’
This point is exactly what issues of repatriation revolve around: where the cultural heritage of countries should reside. As French president Emmanuel Macron stated concerning the return of African artifacts, ‘African heritage can’t just be in European private collections and museums.’ For many in countries that were once part of an empire, this is, though, the norm.
Artworks set to ‘come home’ to Nigeria include artifacts looted during the ‘punitive expedition’ by British troops to take Benin in 1897. During the expedition, troops looted the royal palace taking what is estimated to have been over 4,000 pieces. The treasures taken range from bronze reliefs to carved ivory. Artifacts from Benin have found their way into well-known institutions including London’s British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. This includes what are now known as the Benin Bronzes which often sit in the crux of repatriation issues.
This announcement has received praise and criticism. It is a step in the right direction, as stated by Prince Akenzua, however some critics believe it is not enough. Also, critics are concerned that such agreements will dismiss talks of repatriation. Christian Kopp, from the Berlin Postkolnial, has recognized the proposal as ‘shameful power politics’ stating that European museums should be asking for loans after the restitution of artifacts.
The world will be watching as negotiations concerning the Benin Dialogue Group and various countries continue to reach agreements for the temporary return of artifacts. The group will meet again in 2019 in Benin City, Nigeria and then at the British Museum in London in 2020 ahead of the 2021 opening of the Benin Royal Museum.",,,european museum consistently tie issue repatriation artwork loot take home country throughout history british museum one museum housing artifact artwork various place take many year british conquest empire effort bring artifact home nigeria recently release plan new benin royal museum begin process temporarily least 19 october dutch city leiden museum official austria germany netherlands sweden agree lend nigerian artwork artifact home country three year period work part permanent display new museum agreement though right wrong past generation exactly repatriate work certainly nudge right direction museum work progress issue benin dialogue group see loan endpoint negotiation nigeria waive claim ownership however prince gregory akenzua engoie evbobanosa benin royal family state happy make progress effort give people opportunity access heritage loot point exactly issue repatriation revolve around cultural heritage country reside french president emmanuel macron state concern return african artifact african heritage cant european private collection museum many country part empire be though norm artwork set come home nigeria include artifact loot punitive expedition british troop take benin 1897 expedition troop loot royal palace take estimate 4000 piece treasure take range bronze relief carve ivory artifact benin found way well know institution include london british museum metropolitan museum art new york include know benin bronze often sit crux repatriation issue announcement receive praise criticism step right direction state prince akenzua however critic believe enough also critic concerned agreement dismiss talk repatriation christian kopp berlin postkolnial recognize proposal shameful power politics state european museum ask loan restitution artifact world watch negotiation concern benin dialogue group various country continue reach agreement temporary return artifact group meet 2019 benin city nigeria british museum london 2020 ahead 2021 opening benin royal museum,european museum consist tie issu repatri artwork loot taken home countri throughout histori british museum one museum hous artifact artwork variou place taken mani year british conquest empir effort bring artifact home nigeria recent releas plan new benin royal museum begin process temporarili least 19 octob dutch citi leiden museum offici austria germani netherland sweden agre lend nigerian artwork artifact home countri three year period work part perman display new museum agreement though right wrong past gener exactli repatri work certainli nudg right direct museum work progress issu benin dialogu group see loan endpoint negoti nigeria waiv claim ownership howev princ gregori akenzua engoi evbobanosa benin royal famili state happi make progress effort give peopl opportun access heritag loot point exactli issu repatri revolv around cultur heritag countri resid french presid emmanuel macron state concern return african artifact african heritag cant european privat collect museum mani countri part empir is though norm artwork set come home nigeria includ artifact loot punit expedit british troop take benin 1897 expedit troop loot royal palac take estim 4000 piec treasur taken rang bronz relief carv ivori artifact benin found way well known institut includ london british museum metropolitan museum art new york includ known benin bronz often sit crux repatri issu announc receiv prais critic step right direct state princ akenzua howev critic believ enough also critic concern agreement dismiss talk repatri christian kopp berlin postkolni recogn propos shame power polit state european museum ask loan restitut artifact world watch negoti concern benin dialogu group variou countri continu reach agreement temporari return artifact group meet 2019 benin citi nigeria british museum london 2020 ahead 2021 open benin royal museum
115,Art Restitution Regaining Momentum: What Holds Museums ...,https://magazine.artland.com/art-restitution-regaining-momentum-what-holds-museums-back/,"Art Restitution Regaining Momentum: What Holds Museums Back?
By Adam Hencz
Nigerian artist Emeka Ogboh recently pasted a series of posters throughout more than 200 locations in Dresden to remind the German public about its role in his native country’s missing heritage. Unveiled on December 29, the “missing poster” series was launched in a German city which is home to five objects looted by the British troops back in 1897 from the former royal palace in Benin, the so-called ‘Benin Bronzes’. Ogboh’s appeal comes at a time when the subject of colonial restitution has been emerging from an insider topic within museum communities to a worldwide public issue. In contemporary disputes, restitution not only refers to the return of unlawfully stolen property in times of war but also to reinstating status and legitimacy to those who had their property seized and ownership rights denied for the benefit of the colonial power.
The global movement for art restitution has strengthened considerably in the past years, and dialogues are pushed to a tipping point of the permanent repatriation of looted items. Institutions are pressured by lawmakers across Europe to make the final steps towards returning the plundered objects to their rightful communities but, in the meantime, the recent zealous efforts have raised even more complex questions concentrating on how and who they shall be eventually returned to.
The Case Of The Benin Bronzes
The Benin Bronzes – a huge range of items, from engraved ivory tusks to brass sculptures and plaques – have become highly charged symbols of the cultural injustice perpetrated during the colonial era as well as of the movement dedicated to returning cultural treasures looted during colonialism. The Benin Bronzes were produced starting in the 15th century in the wealthy and industrious Kingdom of Benin, present-day Nigeria. Many of these items were used during rituals, and provide an important historical record and visual archive of the Kingdom of Benin, in a society that did not use the written word. Key elements of the Benin Bronzes are the plaques which once decorated the Benin Royal Palace. In 1897, the palace was looted and razed by British soldiers during a punitive expedition, and the bronzes are now dispersed throughout major international Western museums, including the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, with Germany holding the largest number of objects.
The British Museum has long faced calls to return the bronzes to Africa, but the limitations of laws governing the return and restitution of illicitly exported or stolen cultural property, and the significant differences between national legal regimes, prevent the return or restitution of cultural objects in many cases. Despite a historical precedent for repatriation – the British Museum returned some 25 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria in the 1950s – since 1963 the institution is restricted by the British Museum government act, which prevents it from returning any more objects. As art restitution due to law enforcement has been often unsuccessful, it relies more and more on dialogues, agreements and alternative methods of solutions directly involving key museum representatives from both sides. While several African nations have made formal requests for the return of objects from Western national collections, and several museums have committed to long-term loans to African partners, the full transfer of ownership has been a sticking point.
The French Bill
France marks the latest significant development in Western attitude towards restitution. French President Emmanuel Macron, in a speech delivered on a 2017 visit to the West African republic of Burkina Faso – a former part of the French colonial empire – made a promise to make the restitution of French-owned African heritage a priority over the following five years. France, like many other Western countries in the possession of African heritage that was looted during the colonial period, had to pave a legal path around centuries-old principles that protects objects in the national collection from being deaccessioned. Last November, a landmark bill was passed by the French Senate that would allow for the restitution of 27 objects from the French national collections to Benin and Senegal before the end of 2021.
Macron’s promise and the French bill set the future direction of a decades-long debate in France over art restitution, and shed light onto the question of how exactly repatriation should be carried out and restitution requests handled. The bill originally proposed by the French Senate included the creation of a National Council that would advise on future claims received by French institutions, but the National Assembly later reduced the provision, adopting a case-by-case approach that would require individual approval from the president. France’s example increases the pressure on museums across Europe, which has been building on several fronts.
Pragmatic Dilemma
The current debate continues between the two different attitudes towards restitution: one – well represented by France – supporting the return of artefacts that were looted historically; the other stressing the international nature of cultural heritage that is less favourable to return and restitution. The arguments for the latter are stemming from the fear of Western museums becoming emptied due to the efforts of art restitution. It is also emphasized a purported lack of readiness and local infrastructure to preserve the objects on the part of African countries.
Art restitution claims received a boost with the release of a 2018 report commissioned by the French government that calls for wholesale restitution of artefacts seized during the colonial era. The report from academics Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy argues that “transitional solutions,” like temporary returns or loans, should be in place only “until legal mechanisms are found to allow the final and unconditional return of heritage objects to the African continent.” Even though long-term loans are often criticized for neglecting the question of ownership and colonial violence, they indeed give institutions time while they allocate resources to the challenges revolving around questions of how to determine what objects from their respective collections were plundered and who they should be returned to on these terms.
Returning the objects to African governments might not be the only solution, since the borderlines of African countries have been constructed by the accident of colonialism, and, in many cases, the plundered artefacts represent communities that spread beyond contemporary national borders. These communities are eager to reconnect to their past and cultural heritage. Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi, the curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA, poses the crucial question whether the focus of art restitution should be on the physical objects or on the intangible culture and heritage that accompanied these artefacts. The curator also urges the creation of a research pipeline involving intellectuals from the African continent and diaspora to help devise practical ideas and actionable plans that take the interests of the rightful owners and ultimately address historical injustices wherever they are found.
For the time being, many institutions are waiting for government guidance and are still fighting for vaulting the insurmountable legal hurdles to deaccessioning. Whatever the stage of the debate, most experts agree that the restitution movement has long been inching forward and by now has gathered an unstoppable momentum. The upcoming decade could lay out historic fundamentals for eventually reinstating cultural heritage across former colonies.",,2021-01-15,art restitution regain momentum hold museum back adam hencz

116,Why African Artists and Curators Want Action from Museums ...,https://time.com/5901806/african-artifacts-museums/,"Grace Ndiritu has always thought of her work as both spiritual and political. The British-Kenyan artist uses video installations, paintings and performance practices with different communities, working with groups including refugees in Brussels and Indigenous activists in Argentina. Since 2012, she’s been working on a personal project called “Healing the Museum,” stemming from her feeling that museums were not connected with what was going on in the outside world, and were not welcoming to all communities. “I felt like the way to change or engage with museums is to use other methods like shamanism and meditation to open up the discussion about how we use objects and how we interact as people together in museum spaces,” she says.
As part of a two-year international project titled “Everything Passes Except the Past,” Ndiritu was invited by Germany’s Goethe Institute to hold a “Healing the Museum” performance and workshop last year in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Brussels. The institution has a loaded history: it was initially built in 1898 to showcase the colonial spoils and violence led by King Leopold II in what was then the Congo Free State, even housing a “human zoo” in the museum’s gardens. After a long-awaited renovation promising to address and revamp the museum’s telling of its colonial history, it reopened in 2018 to mixed reactions. A year later, Ndiritu held a meditation workshop in one of the museum’s rooms showcasing objects, specifically mineral artifacts, that had been stolen from the Congo. For Congolese artist Freddy Mutombo, joining the workshop in this setting had a profound effect on him. “For me, this room symbolizes the current suffering of the Congolese people and the war for minerals. So it was all the more powerful.”
Debates over the restitution and repatriation of looted colonial-era objects from European museums back to their sites of origin have been happening for decades. But this year, amid the Black Lives Matter movement originating in the U.S., and broader protests against racial injustice across Europe, more people are connecting the scars of colonial violence to its modern-day legacies.

These considerations coincide with the culmination of “Everything Passes Except the Past,” which brought together artists like Ndiritu and Mutombo, as well as curators, art historians and educators from across Africa, Latin America and Europe to explore the colonial heritage of European museums. The Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, an Italian arts gallery based in Turin, is hosting an exhibition featuring the work of Ndiritu and other artists in response to these themes.
The project comes at an interesting time for both Germany and Italy, which experienced waves of protests against racial injustice this year. As the pandemic and the eruption of the Black Lives Matter movement have prompted people to reflect on issues like restitution, institutions across Europe are grappling with how to respond to demands for the return of objects. These debates are particularly fraught in Germany and Italy. The German colonial empire occupied large parts of modern-day African countries in the late 19th and early 20th century, including Rwanda, Tanzania and Cameroon. It also committed the first genocide of the 20th century, against the Herero and Nama people of modern-day Namibia; earlier this year, the Namibian president turned down the German government’s offer for reparations saying that compensation and terminology used needed to be revised. Italy’s colonial empire included Eritrea, Ethiopia and Libya, and under Fascist leader Mussolini in the 1930s, expanded and consolidated its empire, merging these countries to become the Italian East Africa colony. Observers note today that the country’s colonial history is not taught in schools and is rarely acknowledged by politicians. The Black Lives Matter movement struggled to take off in Italy in the same way as other European countries this summer, although the brutal beating and killing of a young Black man near Rome sparked public outcry in September.
How the restitution debate has changed in recent years
In 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech in Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, in which he promised that the return of African artifacts would be a “top priority for his government.” Art historian Didier Houénoudé says that speech set a different tone for the debate on restitution. “We went from a categorical and polite refusal to an expression of a possibility of discussion, from a ‘No! Impossible!’ to a ‘Yes, maybe but…,’” says Houénoudé, who is a specialist in Beninese cultural heritage and contemporary art, and also participated in the “Everything Passes Except the Past” project.
Macron later commissioned Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and French art historian Bénédicte Savoy to investigate the question of repatriation in France. Their groundbreaking 2018 report called for French museums to permanently return an estimated 90,000 sub-Saharan African artifacts, if the country of origin asks for them. The report also suggested a procedure for their return. “[The origins of these artifacts] is no longer a secret. Now more people are realizing this is a war-related and colonialism-related issue, and there’s more knowledge, awareness and transparency,” Savoy says.
For artist Mutombo too, there has been an evolution in attitudes towards restitution since Macron’s announcement. Mutombo’s artistic practice is multidisciplinary, and reflects on the history of the Congo. His recent project, titled “Explorations,” uses archive images from the Congo during the colonial era. “History has a central place in my work,” he says. “I think of it from a double point of view: that of the colonized and that of the colonizer.” Mutombo says that in recent years, it has become much easier for him to access the archives at the Royal Museum for Central Africa near Brussels. He says that his requests for archival material used to be refused, but the museum now supports his work.
Action has been slow
While some museums have shown themselves to be more willing to engage in these discussions, others have “shown their anguish at seeing themselves stripped of the collections they hold,” says Houénoudé. Although a recent bill passed through the French Senate that would guarantee the permanent return of 26 objects looted from Benin during a violent 19th century siege, as well as a Senegalese sword and scabbard, no items have been returned permanently from French museums since Sarr and Savoy made their recommendations two years ago. The British Museum too has been critiqued for announcing plans to loan the Benin Bronzes back to Nigeria, rather than permanently return them. “In a way, colonization continues, and Europe does not want to give back the thousands of objects it has badly acquired,” Mutombo says. “Paternalistic and unbalanced relationships have not disappeared with the wave of a magic wand.”
He is not alone in critiquing the slowness of museums to act, rather than only talk or debate about the issue of restitution. For art historian Houénoudé, the cooperation and dialogue between European countries and African states has mostly been one-sided, and often condescending on the part of European states. “Europe gives (lessons) and Africa receives (these lessons),” he writes in an email to TIME.
How African artists, activists and curators are taking matters into their own hands
Historically, arguments against restitution and repatriation have included the claim that “African institutions may lack capacity and resources to preserve, research, and display [objects] adequately,” according to a recent report by the African Foundation for Development. Some say this reflects an ongoing paternalistic attitude towards African countries, where curators and experts have for some time been planning how to best store and display these objects in ways more relevant to their specific cultural context. Yaa Addae, a Ghanaian writer and researcher who took part in a workshop in Lisbon as part of “Everything Passes Except the Past,” is planning a series of community workshops looking at the futures of restitution, and what it might look like when a community, rather than a state or government, takes stewardship of returned ancestral art and objects. She’s been inspired by the work of indigenous and Black American curators and activists, as well as institutions who have approached restitution in innovative ways, like Yale Union, a contemporary arts centre in Portland, Oregon, which repatriated its only building to a Native American group earlier this year.
“Even in Ghana, we still use colonial forms of display,” says Addae, who has been thinking of ways objects can connect with communities. “I’m looking at case studies for how to reintegrate loot back into communities, and how to work against that paternalistic idea of, ‘oh we can’t return the art because nobody knows how to look after it,’” she says.
Addae, along with artist Ndiritu and other participants of the project, wrote an essay about her practices for inclusion in a catalogue to accompany the project, scheduled to publish in December. In her contribution, Addae writes about the different forms museums could take, and how objects in Ghanaian culture are not just works of art, but works of craftsmanship with purpose and function, like ancestral masks for example. “It doesn’t seem helpful to have something that was made to be used in life and the community behind a glass wall with a label, and not honoring its true intention,” she says. Addae previously worked with the ANO Institute of Arts and Knowledge in Accra, Ghana, as a researcher on their mobile museums project, which reimagined a museum as dynamic rather than fixed in one location, moving around different regions of Ghana and interacting with different communities to tell their own histories through their words.
Across the continent, researchers and experts are preparing to safely receive and conserve their cultural heritage. Benin City, the capital of Edo State in Nigeria, will host a new Benin Royal Museum, intended to house the famous Benin Bronzes and scheduled to open in 2021. In Senegal, the Museum of Black Civilizations opened in 2018, and currently holds the sword and scabbard included in the list of objects that France could move to permanently return.
Some fear that despite African efforts, European institutions remain unwilling to reckon with the past. Mutombo points to the case of Belgium’s legacy in the Congo. While he would like to see restitution of at least 70% of the Royal Museum for Central Africa’s collections to the Congo, he doesn’t think Belgium is prepared to recognize “the dark side of its history” in the country.
And some are refusing to wait for European museums to stop talking about restitution and reparation and are starting actions in a literal sense. In June, Congolese activist Mwazulu Diyanbanza, along with four other activists, livestreamed themselves attempting to remove a Chadian funeral staff from display at Paris’ Musée du Quai Branly-Jacques Chirac. Four activists were charged in October of aggravated theft and received fines.
The lack of African cultural heritage in Africa will only lead to greater discontent among younger people, says Houénoudé, who is also a lecturer and teacher at University Abomey-Calavi in Benin. He says many of his students support Diyabanza’s actions as a legitimate way to reclaim their heritage. “It is painful that others always want to teach us about how we preserve our heritage, about our history that these others have themselves painstakingly destroyed.”",,2020-10-20,grace ndiritu always thought work spiritual political british kenyan artist us video installation painting performance

Koret Auditorium
Come and hear from two international experts of Nigerian historical art, Barbara Plankensteiner, director of the Museum am Rothenbaum in Hamburg, Germany, and a founding member of the Benin Dialogue Group, and Ndubuisi ""Endy"" Ezeluomba, the Françoise Billion Richardson Curator of African Art at the New Orleans Museum of Art, as they discuss the restitution of looted Benin Kingdom artifacts in a conversation moderated by Constantine Petridis, curator of African art at the Art Institute of Chicago.
The release in November 2018 of a report on the restitution of African cultural heritage, written by academics Felwine Sarr and Benedicte Savoy upon the request of French President Emmanuel Macron, has reopened thinking and conversation about issues of cultural patrimony and heritage in light of Africa's colonial history. This past year, the complex subjects of restitution and repatriation have been debated from various disciplinary perspectives in numerous conferences and colloquia around the world. These debates have also caught the attention of social and cultural groups on three continents and incited demands for the return of human remains as well as of archives and cultural objects from collections in former colonial nations. Responses to the Sarr-Savoy report have ranged widely but all agree on the many challenges it poses, and few doubt its far-reaching impact on the status of African art in Europe and the United States.
The famous so-called bronzes from the Benin Kingdom in Nigeria, which were mostly looted during a raid by British colonials in 1897, have long been at the center of the restitution debate pertaining to the African continent. Inspired by recommendations of the Benin Dialogue Group in October 2018, prior to the release of the Sarr-Savoy report, officials of the British Museum in London and other museums in Europe that house important numbers of works stemming from this military expedition have agreed to loan important artifacts back to a new museum for art looted from the Benin Kingdom that Nigeria. However, as demonstrated by the recent failed attempt by the RISD Museum (Rhode Island School of Design's art museum in Providence, RI) to return one 18th-century brass commemorative sculpture of the head of a Benin king, tracing the provenance of colonial-era artifacts is far from simple and implementing their actual repatriation is quite complicated a matter.

119,LILY SAINT - The West Must Return the Artifacts They Stole ...,https://www.theelephant.info/op-eds/2021/06/04/the-west-must-return-the-artifacts-they-stole-back-to-africa/,"In 1909, Sir Ralph Denham Rayment Moor, British Consul General of the British Southern Nigerian Protectorate, took his life by ingesting cyanide. Eleven years earlier, following Britain’s “punitive” attack on Benin City’s Royal Court, Moor helped transfer loot taken from Benin City into Queen Victoria’s private collection and to the British Foreign Office. Pilfered materials taken by Moor and many others include the now famous brass reliefs depicting the history of the Benin Kingdom—known collectively as the Benin Bronzes.
This is in addition to commemorative brass heads and tableaux; carved ivory tusks; decorative and bodily ornaments; healing, divining, and ceremonial objects; and helmets, altars, spoons, mirrors, and much else. Moor also kept things for himself, including the Queen Mother ivory hip-mask. After Moor’s suicide, British ethnologist Charles Seligman, famous for promoting the racist “Hamitic hypothesis” undergirding much early eugenicist thought, purchased this same mask, one of six known examples.
With his wife Brenda Seligman, an anthropologist in her own right, Charles amassed a giant collection of “ethnographic objects.” In 1958, Brenda sold the Queen Mother mask for £20,000 to Nelson Rockefeller, who featured it in his now-defunct Museum of Primitive Art before gifting it in 1972 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. That’s where I visited it this week in New York City—and as Dan Hicks pointed out in a recent tweet, if you are reading this in the global North, there’s a good chance that an item taken from the Benin Court is in the collection of a regional, university, or national museum near you, too.
For Hicks, author of The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution, this provenance history of the Queen Mother mask—and every single other history of the acquisition and transfer of objects from Benin City to museums across the “developed” world—is a history that begins and ends in violence. Indeed, the category of ethnographic museums emerged in the nineteenth century precisely out of the demonic alliance between anthropological inquiry and colonial pillage.
In 1919, a German ethnologist observed that “the spoils of war [Kriegsbeute] made during the conquest of Benin … were the biggest surprise that the field of ethnology had ever received.” These so-called spoils buttressed these museums’ raison d’être: to collect and display non-Western cultures as evidence of “European victory over ‘primitive’, archaeological African cultures.”
The formation of ethnographic museums, including the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, where Hicks currently works, “have compounded killings, cultural destructions and thefts with the propaganda of race science [and] with the normalisation of the display of human cultures in material form” (my italics). For Hicks, the continued display of these stolen objects in poorly lit basement rooms, sophisticated modern vitrines, and private collections is an “enduring brutality … refreshed every day that an anthropology museum … opens its doors.”
After this book, there can be no more false justifications for holding Benin Bronzes in museums outside of Africa, nor further claims that changing times mean new approaches are sufficient for recontextualizing art objects. This book inaugurates its own paradigm shift in museum practices, collection, and ethics. While there are preceding arguments for returning Western museums’ holdings in African art (most notably Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy’s Restitution of African Cultural Heritage, or Rapport sur la restitution du patrimoine culturel africain), the comprehensiveness of Hicks’s argument is extraordinary.
In chapter after chapter, shifting agilely between historical perspectives and conceptual frameworks, he revisits the siege on Benin and its afterlives in museums across the globe. From Hicks’s detailed appendix, we learn that these stolen objects can be found in approximately 161 different museums and galleries worldwide, from the British Museum to the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, with only 11 on the African continent.
For part of the book, Hicks engages in a kind of conventional historiography, tracing how the Benin Punitive Expedition was justified, planned, and funded by a range of individuals and institutions in chartered joint-stock companies, the military, the British government, and the press. The 1897 British “expedition” to Benin City in present-day Nigeria was defended by the British as a necessary “punitive” response to the killing of at least four white men.
These men had been murdered trying to make their way to the City of Benin, doing so despite the strict injunction given previously by the Oba that they not attempt entry or else they would face death. Hicks traces how the British regularly fabricated reasons for this kind of retributive violence (often even in the name of abolitionism) to mask what was actually a concatenation of overlapping “small wars” and punitive expeditions reaching back into the middle of the 19th century.
An accretion of details halfway into the book—the maneuvers and lines of attack, the catalogues of officers, Hausa soldiers and carriers, the weight and numbers and types of guns and other weaponry (“Dane guns (muzzle-loading smooth-bore flintlock muskets), pistols, machetes, cutlasses, spears, bows and arrows, knives”)—makes the book sag a little in the middle.
While this will grab the attention of those readers interested in plumbing colonialism’s ultraviolent depths and its flagrant disregard for the legal limits of what was permissible in war (we learn of bullets filed down “to convert them into expanding bullets [to] cause a more extensive wound when hitting a human target,” for instance), for those most interested in Hicks’s arguments about the ethnographic museum today, I recommend skipping ahead to the last chapters.
For after all, Hicks’s details recount a history that has been woefully told and retold in different incarnations: a narrative of extraction, ultraviolence, racism. The Brutish Museums’ most forceful contribution lies ultimately in Hicks’s assessment and condemnation of the present state of affairs of museum curatorship, especially within anthropological museums and associated institutions.
The complicity of museum curators and staff in efforts to justify the looting is not unique to the early collectors and anthropologists. Hicks deplores the rhetorical ruses of contemporary curators and museum officials who gloss over the problem at the heart of museums’ acquisitions by arguing instead that museums have become “international,” “borderless,” and “universal” spaces showcasing “world culture.” These claims that a kind of international inclusivity can be brought about under the banner of the “universal museum,” and that this is sufficient to remedy the violences inherent in the collections themselves, sidestep the fact that that such frameworks do nothing to dislodge the colonial geographic logic of metropole and periphery that brought the museums into existence in the first place.
Hicks also picks a fight with art history’s love affair with Object Studies, a field which treats an object’s meaning as determined mainly by its context and reception. As he points out, this often allows us to detach an object from the (often violent) human histories that brought those newer meanings into being. The misuse of Mary-Louise Pratt’s concept of the “contact zone” as a way to organize museum collections comes under similar attack, since curators have used it to emphasize colonial cultural encounters as exchanges and “entanglements” rather than as relations of subordination and pillage under duress.
Today, Hicks avows: “A time of taking is giving way to a time of returns.” As Greer Valley has pointed out, there have been endless debates; action is the only possible way forward. Some museums and galleries have heeded the call to repatriate stolen material culture, and museums such as Senegal’s Museum of Black Civilizations in Dakar and the soon-to-be-built Edo Museum of Western African Art in Benin City (designed by architect David Adjaye) indicate that shifts are occurring at the level of action as well as idea.
In order for repatriation to be accelerated and standardized, museums particularly need to be more transparent about their holdings. Hicks notes that “it is … currently unclear how many skulls and other human remains taken from Benin survive in museums and private collections—although at least five human teeth found their way from Benin City in 1897 to London, and are now lying at the British Museum in a divination kit, strung on a necklace, and contained within a brass mask.” It’s not apparent to me why museums aren’t able to give an appropriate account of both what objects they have and how they have come to have them. In recent debates in the US about human remains held at the University of Pennsylvania’s Archeology and Anthropology Museum, the Smithsonian, Harvard University, and elsewhere, similar obstacles are regularly raised about these problems of counting collections. But catalogs need to be clear and made public, and museums must hold themselves accountable in both material and ethical senses. This, they all know now, means the first necessary step is to return what is not theirs. How they then reinvent themselves as spaces of accountability will be the next task of the curator.

  The Department of Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology invites the Bryn Mawr College community to join in a conversation with  Dan Hicks , Professor of Contemporary Archaeology and Curator of World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford.  The event has been rescheduled for December 4 at 12pm.  Professor Hicks will speak about his new book  The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution  (Pluto Press), released on November 5, 2020. The Bryn Mawr community has access to an e-copy of the book through  Tripod .*

 Dan Hicks’  The Brutish Museums  is an honest critique of modern museum practice, calling for European and American archaeological and anthropological museums to confront their own legacies and to return objects acquired through acts of state sponsored corporate colonial violence. Hicks takes these museums to task in underscoring the injustice of retaining, and displaying, cultural objects that were acquired during the colonial wars of the modern era. His argument is framed through the lens of the “Benin Bronzes,” an assemblage of metal and ivory art objects that are part of the ancestral and ceremonial heritage of the Benin royal family – a royal lineage that has existed unbroken since the 14th century. These objects were removed from the Kingdom of Benin (modern Nigeria) in 1897 by British forces as part of a punitive expedition and now are on display in over 160 museums and collections worldwide.  The Brutish Museums  makes a moral case for the return of these and similar objects extracted by colonial violence to still living communities. On November 13, Professor Hicks will talk about issues related to artifact restitution and the future of the anthropological museum in his conversation with the Bryn Mawr community.

   
 The Brutish Museums  is as much a political philosophy of museum practice as it is a roadmap for a new museum ethics. Hicks begins with highlighting the problems of colonialist narratives that emerged from the removal of the Benin Bronzes – narratives that still populate the public didactics of the museums displaying these objects. These narratives provide a tempered and incomplete version of events that de-emphasize or ignore the burning of Benin City and the massacre of city residents that accompanied the removal of ancestral objects. Hicks critiques the validity of popular colonial narratives in museum didactics, but also the ethics of museums in perpetuating these narratives while presenting objects as examples of an objective human past.

  Despite the claims of popular narratives of the 1897 Benin City massacre, the author notes that there is hardly ever an interrogation of the moral justification for Queen Victoria’s military presence in Benin in the display contexts of the Benin Bronzes. Hicks explains that it was during the 1890’s that the British government sought to negotiate the annexation of Benin as a British protectorate in exchange for the corporate extraction of the region’s natural resources – an annexation wholly resisted by the Oba (king) of the Benin royal family. In the lead up to the 1897 massacre, six British officers entered Benin city during a religious festival they were expressly prohibited from witnessing as foreigners. The deaths of four officers was seized upon as an opportunity for the crown to depose the Oba and then exploit Benin’s natural resources. It was under this pretext that British forces burned Benin City in 1897 and removed the objects that frame  The Brutish Museums .

  Hicks argues for the unmitigated return of the Benin Bronzes from every collection that has benefited from the 1897 punitive expedition, including the Pitt Rivers Museum. For the author, the restitution of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria is to serve as an exemplar for the tens of thousands of other cultural objects seized by force from societies across the globe in acts of state sanctioned colonial violence. When museums enlist illicit objects to illustrate the past, Hicks argues, they become complicit in the dehumanizing effects of the theft of cultural objects. As beneficiaries and shields for colonial violence, the author refers to museums as “weapons.” The point identifies precisely why restitution is not an academic, philosophical curio for institutional actors to debate under the guise of “decolonizing” disciplines. Hicks urges museums and collections that hold Benin Bronzes, and objects similarly extracted by colonial violence, to immediately repatriate these objects to their rightful owners: the living communities that continue to suffer the loss of objects of their own cultural heritage.  The Brutish Museums  argues that it is only then that a new ethical museum can emerge.

121,What are “the Benin Bronzes” and where are they now?,https://liberalarts.du.edu/art-collection-ethics/news-events/all-articles/what-are-benin-bronzes-and-where-are-they-now,"What are “the Benin Bronzes” and where are they now?
Recent news articles have been tracking international negotiations over the Benin Bronzes — thousands of African artifacts at the center of complicated disputes involving some of the world’s most prestigious museums. The very term “Benin Bronzes” is misleading, as they are not from the country of Benin, nor necessarily made from bronze.
The theft of these items from the Kingdom of Benin, in present-day southern Nigeria, is beyond dispute. In 1897, Britain launched a punitive expedition to consolidate imperial control in the region, and plundered more than 4,000 objects from the royal palace. These items commonly known as the Benin Bronzes include sculptures and other objects made from bronze, ivory, wood or brass. Among the most famous are sixteenth- and seventeenth-century brass plaques that formerly adorned the Benin Royal Palace and today are held by the British Museum, along with some 700 other Benin items.
Through gifts and multiple sales, the sculptures have ended up in museums across Europe and the United States, and in private collections, a dispersal fueled in part by the art market. In 2007, for instance, a sixteenth-century bronze head of a Benin Oba, or divine ruler, fetched over $4 million at auction from a private collector.
Nigeria has been asking for the return of these items for decades, with formal claims submitted to the British Museum in the 1970s. Working toward a solution, an international consortium of museums in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden joined with Nigerian representatives in 2007 to form the Benin Dialogue Group (BDG). The group aims to establish a permanent display of dispersed Benin artworks in a royal museum in Benin City, Nigeria. According to a statement of the BDG following a meeting in July 2019, the plans are moving forward, most likely through a system of long-term loans. Notably absent from the BDG are museums in the United States and France.
The subject of restitution and repatriation of African objects has been a regular story in the news, spurred in part by French president Emmanuel Macron’s pledge in 2017 to explore “temporary or permanent restitution of African heritage to Africa.” Macron’s proclamation led to a commissioned report advocating the full restitution of some African items held in French state-run museums, generating controversy in France and throughout the museum world.
In November 2018, France pledged to return 26 items to the state of Benin, a former French colony. The effort has stalled, however, as deaccession requires an act of parliament. The French government now aims to repatriate the items by 2021.
Among the Benin Bronzes in the U.K., two artifacts formerly held by a private collector have been returned to Nigeria, thanks in part to the efforts of British police officers Steve Dunstone and Timothy Awoyemi. (Read more about their story here.)
The repatriation debates have prompted other initiatives. In the Netherlands, the National Museum of World Cultures published guidelines in March 2019 calling for restitution of items taken without consent. And in a significant private effort announced last November, the George Soros-funded Open Society Foundations pledged $15 million to promote repatriation of cultural objects to Africa.
For some Africans, the legacy of colonial plunder is not only about lost heritage, but also current art production. According to Nigerian artist Victor Ehikhamenor, the loss of these cultural artifacts left “a gaping hole in Nigerian art history,” affecting the trajectory of Nigerian contemporary art. The remedy, in his view, is straightforward: return what belongs to Nigerians. Ehikamenor argues that a museum setting displays these objects out of context, diminishing their meaning and original intention. In contrast, Benin City governor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki advocates allowing museums around the world to display these objects and foster connections with other cultures. Opinions differ on how best to address this complicated subject, but the question remains: will African art return to Africans?

122,The Long Fight for the Restitution of African Artifacts | Condé ...,https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-long-fight-for-restitution,"The vast majority—up to 90 percent—of sub-Saharan Africa’s physical cultural heritage is held outside of Africa. Among these items are the Benin Bronzes, sculptures used for ancestral altars and to validate the accession of the new oba (king), objects from Maqdala that are spiritually important in Northern Ethiopia, stuffed lions from Kenya, sculptures of a fish eagle from Zimbabwe, and statues, manuscripts, masks, thrones, and human remains, plundered from the continent over centuries. In December 2018, amid long-standing discussions about restitution, the Museum of Black Civilizations (MCN) opened in Dakar, Senegal. Documenting the history of the Black world—past, present, and future—was its central project. And its request to the world? That looted, plundered, and stolen African artifacts held in museums off the continent be sent back.
“The principal idea of the MCN is that we no longer allow anyone to tell us who we are,” says professor Hamady Bocoum, the museum's head curator and general manager. “We will tell who we are, and will assume who we are.” This idea that Africans and those throughout the diaspora must control their own narrative is what the MCN’s work and call for restitution is all about. The call is not new—governments and museums across Africa have been asking for restitution since at least the 1960s, when African nations gained independence. But the MCN is unique: As one of the most modern museums in the world, with generous funding and advanced resources, it's well positioned to care for artifacts from across the continent, and also to recover them from the rest of the world.
But a couple years after their call for restitution, they’re still waiting.
Despite the press that MCN’s restitution call received (and acknowledgements from other museums in response), to date the museum has only received one item back—the sword of Omar Saidou Tall—returned in 2019 as a gesture of good faith by the French government. This is part of a legislative step to restitute 26 artifacts back to Benin, and to formally transfer ownership of the sword to Senegal within one year—but that movement began in 2017, before the MCN call.
Many museums, in France and elsewhere, say they fear their walls and exhibitions will be empty if they return items. Onyekachi Wambu, executive director of AFFORD, the African Foundation for Development in the United Kingdom, rejects that argument.“Why do you have Ghanian treasures in your museum? Put your real history in the museums so we can all have a conversation about how the U.K. was built, rather than filling the museums with the Elgin marbles, Benin treasures, or Egyptian treasures, and pretending that’s got something to do with British history.” France may be slowly moving forward on restitution, but the UK, U.S., and other Western countries and museums are not taking such concrete steps; instead engaging in seemingly endless dialogue with few concrete plans and timelines for giving items back.",,2020-08-28,vast majority—up 90 percent—of sub saharan africa physical cultural heritage held outside africa among item benin bronze sculpture use ancestral altar validate accession new oba king object maqdala spiritually important northern ethiopia stuffed lion kenya sculpture fish eagle zimbabwe statue manuscript mask throne human remains plunder continent century december 2018 amid long stand discussion restitution museum black civilization mcn open dakar senegal document history black world—past present future—was central project request world loot plunder steal african artifact held museum continent sent back the principal idea mcn longer allow anyone tell be say professor hamady bocoum museum head curator general manager we tell be assume be idea african throughout diaspora must control narrative mcns work call restitution about call new—governments museum across africa ask restitution since least 1960s african nation gain independence mcn unique one modern museum world generous funding advanced resource well position care artifact across continent also recover rest world couple year call restitution theyre still wait despite press mcns restitution call receive and acknowledgement museum response date museum receive one item back—the sword omar saidou tall—returned 2019 gesture good faith french government part legislative step restitute 26 artifact back benin formally transfer ownership sword senegal within one year—but movement begin 2017 mcn call many museum france elsewhere say fear wall exhibition empty return item onyekachi wambu executive director afford african foundation development united kingdom reject argumentwhy ghanian treasure museum put real history museum conversation uk built rather fill museum elgin marble benin treasure egyptian treasure pretend thats get something british history france may slowly move forward restitution uk u western country museum take concrete step instead engage seemingly endless dialogue concrete plan timeline give item back,vast majority—up 90 percent—of sub saharan africa physic cultur heritag held outsid africa among item benin bronz sculptur use ancestr altar valid access new oba king object maqdala spiritu import northern ethiopia stuf lion kenya sculptur fish eagl zimbabw statu manuscript mask throne human remain plunder contin centuri decemb 2018 amid long stand discuss restitut museum black civil mcn open dakar seneg document histori black world—past present future—wa central project request world loot plunder stolen african artifact held museum contin sent back the princip idea mcn longer allow anyon tell are say professor hamadi bocoum museum head curat gener manag we tell are assum are idea african throughout diaspora must control narr mcn work call restitut about call new—govern museum across africa ask restitut sinc least 1960 african nation gain independ mcn uniqu one modern museum world gener fund advanc resourc well posit care artifact across contin also recov rest world coupl year call restitut theyr still wait despit press mcn restitut call receiv and acknowledg museum respons date museum receiv one item back—th sword omar saidou tall—return 2019 gestur good faith french govern part legisl step restitut 26 artifact back benin formal transfer ownership sword seneg within one year—but movement began 2017 mcn call mani museum franc elsewher say fear wall exhibit empti return item onyekachi wambu execut director afford african foundat develop unit kingdom reject argumentwhi ghanian treasur museum put real histori museum convers uk built rather fill museum elgin marbl benin treasur egyptian treasur pretend that got someth british histori franc may slowli move forward restitut uk us western countri museum take concret step instead engag seemingli endless dialogu concret plan timelin give item back
123,French Parliament votes to return stolen artefacts to Benin and ...,https://www.france24.com/en/20201007-french-parliament-votes-to-return-stolen-artefacts-to-benin-and-senegal,"The pieces include a royal throne and statues taken by the French army during a war in Benin—then the wealthy African kingdom of Dahomey—as well a sabre once wielded by a 19th-century Muslim sheik in what is today Senegal.
After 49 MPs in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, voted Tuesday night in favour of the bill—with none voting against—it will now head to the Senate.
If approved, France will officially restore to Benin 26 items from the Treasure of Behanzin, looted during the 1892 pillaging of the palace of Abomey.
They include the throne of King Glele—a centrepiece of the 70,000-odd African objects held at the Quai Branly-Jacques Chirac museum in Paris.
Senegal will get back a sword and scabbard said to have belonged to Omar Saidou Tall, an important 19th century military and religious figure in West Africa.
The pieces are officially held by the Army Museum in Paris, but are on long-term loan to Dakar, where they have been exhibited since last November.
Former culture minister Franck Riester said the return of the artefacts was part of a “strengthened desire for cooperation” with the two francophone West African countries.
He spoke to the assembly because current Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot was isolating after coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case.
Ahead of the vote, Bachelot insisted the bill was “not an act of repentance or reparation, nor a condemnation of the French cultural model”.
‘Strictly the minimum’
President Emmanuel Macron pledged shortly after his election in 2017 to look into the restitution of African cultural treasures.
Benin’s President Patrice Talon has previously said he was “not satisfied” even while welcoming “small steps” being taken by France.
“To approve a specific law to hand back 26 artefacts is strictly the minimum,” he told the magazine Young Africa, arguing for a law that gave “global restitution based on a precise inventory”.
Last month five activists went on trial in Paris for trying to seize an African funeral staff from the Quai Branly, France’s pre-eminent indigenous art museum, in a bid to put new pressure on Macron to return more items.
An expert report commissioned by Macron in 2018 counted some 90,000 African works in French museums, most of them at the Quai Branly.
Britain has also faced calls to return artefacts, notably the Elgin Marbles to Greece and the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, while museums in Belgium and Austria house tens of thousands of African pieces.

124,University Of Aberdeen And German Museums To Repatriate ...,https://www.thevintagenews.com/2021/05/05/benin-bronzes-repatriation/,"The Benin Bronzes is the name given to over a thousand metal plaques and sculptures that were created from the 13th century onwards and represent Benin art today. These artifacts were made in the Kingdom of Benin (also known as the Edo Empire), a pre-colonial African state in what is now southern Nigeria (not to be confused with the modern-day state of Benin).
About the Benin Bronzes
Despite the name, materials used in the construction of the Benin Bronzes included mixtures of bronze and brass, wood, ceramics, and ivory. They were created using the lost-wax casting method and are considered to be some of the finest examples of art created using this process.
These artworks were once contained in the royal palace in the Kingdom of Benin in what is now Nigeria. However, many of these pieces were taken from their homeland by the British in a raid that was known as the Benin Expedition of 1897.
This raid was carried out in retaliation for what the British saw as an attack on a peaceful expedition when a British party led by Vice-Consul General James Robert Phillips was attacked south of Benin by Oba warriors. The British had given notice that they intended to visit Benin but were later told that they could not enter the city while certain rituals were being conducted. When the British ignored such instructions, they were attacked, leaving only two survivors.
After the raid, many of the Benin Bronzes were taken to the British Museum and displayed there. The rest were sold by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to museums in Europe and the United States. While displaying these marvelous pieces of art around the world has led to a greater appreciation of African art and culture, many believe that these artifacts should be brought back to Africa.
Repatriation efforts have been going on for a long time
In an effort to regain these pieces of art, the Nigerian government bought 30 Benin Bronzes from the British Museum between 1950 and 1972. However, this was only because Hermann Braunholtz, the museum’s curator, thought that some of the items the museum held were duplicates and therefore superfluous to the museum’s collection.
In 1960, Nigeria gained independence, and since then has unceasingly sought the return of the Benin Bronzes. The international debate over such repatriation is similar to that surrounding the Elgin Marbles.
In 2020, France approved the restitution of 26 items that it held, and in March 2021, the University of Aberdeen agreed to repatriate a piece it had purchased in 1957. The bronze sculpture depicted the head of Oba, the former king of Benin, and the item was obtained at an auction in 1957.
Neil Curtis, the head of museums and special collections at Aberdeen, told the BBC News that “An ongoing review of the collections identified the Head of Oba as having been acquired in a way that we now consider to have been extremely immoral, so we took a proactive approach to identify the appropriate people to discuss what to do.”
Professor George Boyne, principal and vice-chancellor of Aberdeen University, added: “It would not have been right to have retained an item of such great cultural importance that was acquired in such reprehensible circumstances.”
Less than a month later, Germany made the latest move in this international debate. Contained in museums across the country are more than 500 African artifacts, many of them bronzes.
The German government has been working with the Benin Dialogue Group, a working group that brings together museum directors and international delegates with the aim of establishing a museum in Benin City to display the Bronzes. The German government has been in talks with this group about returning some of the Benin Bronzes to the country.
A digital meeting was held on April 29, 2021, which involved the government, directors of German museums, and the Benin Dialogue Group. A joint statement was issued the next day stating that “the participants are in agreement that addressing Germany’s colonial past is an important issue for the whole of society and a core task for cultural policy.”
It was noted that Germany had already “implemented numerous measures to address the history and origin of their holdings.”

Although it appears that Germany will only “make substantial returns of Benin Bronzes,” meaning that it will hold onto some of them, the joint statement made clear that Germany would be more transparent about the history of the Bronzes in its possession.
In addition, further talks would take place to “reach an understanding with the Nigerian partners on how Benin Bronzes can continue to be shown in Germany.”
The next meeting is scheduled for late May 2021, and it is hoped that the first items will be returned to Nigeria from Germany in 2022.",,2021-05-05,benin bronze name give thousand metal plaque

The Met Museum has announced it will follow suit and return two brass plaques, also part of the Benin Bronzes, to their rightful owners.
The Benin Bronzes refers to a large collection of West African art and has long stood as a symbol of the vast amount of art looted from Africa during colonization. Debates have been going on for years about their restitution, but not, countries are finally acknowledging their responsibility to return the stolen works. Although these are only two of the estimated 160 artifacts the Met has from Benin City, it is a good starting place for restitutions.
The two plaques to be returned, called “Warrior Chief” and “Junior Court Official,” date back to the 16th century and were looted from Benin City, what is now Nigeria, in 1897. The plaques will be given to Abba Isa Tijani, director general of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, when he next visits New York City.

Should Britain send back the Benin Bronzes?
Barnaby Phillips

The Benin Bronzes have a special status in the debate over cultural artefacts taken during the colonial era. Author Barnaby Phillips explains why, and why the British Museum's approach to the debate is unsustainable
At the end of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee summer, in September 1897, the British Museum hosted an unusual exhibition. It was something of a rushed affair, as the objects on display – hundreds of brass castings and sculptures – had only arrived in London a few months earlier.
Journalists did not know what to make of them. ""Surprised"", ""remarkable"", ""baffled""; these words recur throughout their reviews. The objects came from the West African kingdom of Benin (located in modern day southern Nigeria, not the neighbouring country of Benin) which had been conquered by the British in February of that year.
Benin, according to British newspapers, was a place of barbarism, its streets littered with the victims of human sacrifice. And yet now, curators and art critics agreed, the finest of Benin’s sculptures were as sophisticated and beautiful as those from ancient Greece or Renaissance Italy.
There were further grounds for confusion. Africa, according to late Victorian consensus, was a place without history. And yet many of the castings from Benin, detailed depictions of Portuguese soldiers in armour from the 15th and 16th centuries, most likely dated from that time.
In fact, the Benin kingdom and its people – known as the Edo – had enjoyed a harmonious relationship with European traders and explorers for hundreds of years. The Portuguese, the Dutch, the French and the British had all been welcomed at the court of the king, the Oba, where they had traded guns, brass bracelets and cowrie shells for slaves, ivory and pepper.
Benin City was the capital of this kingdom, its streets and palaces compared favourably by European visitors to those of Lisbon and Amsterdam. By the 19th century Britain was the pre-eminent European power on the West African coast, and its relationship with Benin began to sour.

Glasgow and Liverpool traders were hungry for palm-oil and rubber, and the Oba was an obstacle to commerce. Some colonial officials argued for an invasion, and when, in January 1897, several British officials and traders were killed en route to Benin, the government in London agreed that the Oba should go.
Admiral Harry Rawson’s ‘Punitive Expedition’, some 1,200 soldiers and sailors, despatched from Britain, Cape Town and Malta, with Maxim guns and rockets, mowed down the Oba’s soldiers armed with muskets and captured Benin City. The Oba was sent into exile, and never saw his kingdom again.
It was a classic small war of imperial conquest, one of Kipling’s ""savage wars of peace"", but its distinctive significance to us today derives from what happened after the British had seized the Oba’s palace.
That was when Rawson’s men stumbled across the magnificent brass and bronze sculptures and castings, as well as ivory carvings which came to be known collectively as ‘the Benin Bronzes’. It was, said one officer, a ‘regular harvest of loot’, laid out in the courtyard for the British to take their pick, and carried back to the waiting ships by heavily-laden porters and donkeys.
Today, the Benin Bronzes are dispersed around the museums and private collections of Europe and the United States. That process of dispersal began almost immediately; the first auction took place in May 1897, when J. C Stevens’ auction house in Covent Garden advertised in the Times the sale of ""Several Carved Tusks and other trophies from Benin city collected by naval officers in the recent expedition"".
There were many more auctions in subsequent years, as dealers, collectors and curators began to appreciate the significance of the Benin Bronzes, and officers saw the opportunity to cash in on their loot.

During this process their very meaning underwent a transformation. The Benin Bronzes had been made for religious and spiritual purposes, but also as mnemonic devices, recording the history and beliefs of the Edo people. But in Europe they were admired for their aesthetic qualities.
They had become pieces of art. German museums reacted with particular alacrity; the Berlin curator Felix von Luschan rushed to London in the summer of 1897 to make his first purchases.
Uniquely, Luschan recognised the Benin Bronzes not only as artistic masterpieces, but also as objects whose existence was a rebuke to the prevailing values of the time. The Bronzes, Luschan wrote, could help Europeans understand “that the culture of the so called ‘savages’ is not inferior to our own, only different"".
Some 120 years later, museums from Los Angeles to Leipzig are struggling to justify the morality of their collections of Benin Bronzes. In Europe the Black Lives Matter movement has accelerated an already critical interpretation of imperial history, and the Bronzes have become emblematic of the extremely charged debate around the future of colonial-looted art in western museums.
They’ve acquired a special status in this debate, for perhaps two reasons. The first is that they are magnificent, amongst Africa’s greatest treasures, and there are so many of them, (scholars still disagree on just how many thousands the British took in 1897). The second is the manner and timing of their theft.
The looting of Benin City was not a uniquely egregious act of cultural vandalism – from Maqdala to Mandalay, British 19th century military expeditions plundered treasures – but it happened towards the very end of the period of imperial expansion, and is extremely well documented in photographs, letters and journals.
Events are moving fast. In 2017 the French president Emmanuel Macron made an extraordinary speech on a visit to West Africa, saying that within five years, he wanted to see ""conditions are met for the temporary or permanent restitution of African heritage to Africa"".
The report he subsequently commissioned, which came out in 2018, was both a searing indictment of the history of Europe’s museums – ""born from an era of violence"" – and a radical blueprint for change. Several British museums now say they’re prepared to return their Bronzes.
These included the Horniman Museum in London, and the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, both of which have significant collections. The real bombshell came from Germany in April, with the collective decision by its government and museums to begin returning a ""substantial"" number of Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, starting in 2022. Germany’s culture minister, Monika Grütters, said ""dealing with the Benin Bronzes is a touchstone"", of her country’s ""moral responsibility"".
All of which raises the question, what about the British Museum, which hosted that first exhibition back in 1897? It has the largest collection of Benin Bronzes of any museum, almost 1,000, although it only displays some 100.
These include some of the most iconic pieces of all, including the Queen Idia ivory mask, believed to date from the 16th century, and to many Nigerians a symbol of both indigenous cultural achievement but also colonial oppression.
In truth, the British Museum is in an invidious position, prevented by law from permanently returning its Benin Bronzes, even if its trustees or director, Dr Hartwig Fischer, should want to do so.

Boris Johnson’s government has made its position clear; the culture secretary Oliver Dowden has written to national museums, telling them not to remove objects with ""difficult and contentious"" histories.
His letter came with a thinly veiled threat – that government funding could not be taken for granted – which carried significant weight in the midst of the pandemic when other revenue sources have collapsed. But there is also frustration within the British Museum; a feeling that its current leadership is not even trying to engage with the government on the future of the Benin Bronzes and other contested items, but would rather put out bland press statements and hope the problem simply went away.
Already, it is possible to see the outline of a looming PR disaster, whereby many leading European museums do return their Benin Bronzes, but the British Museum is only able to offer some on loan.
In Nigeria itself, there are three bodies with vested interests in the future of the Benin Bronzes: the federal government, the Oba’s palace (the dynasty was restored in 1914) and the Edo state government. Sadly, the discussion over to whom and how the Bronzes should be returned is already provoking rancour. ""It’s about money and politics, not culture and heritage,"" says one Western curator involved in the negotiations.
Awkwardly for the federal government, its underfunded museums already have a sizeable collection of Benin Bronzes – the colonial administration bought dozens of superb specimens in London auctions in the 1940s and 1950s – but have done a poor job at displaying them, and, in some notorious cases, failed to prevent their theft back to Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, there are simmering rivalries and jealousies between the Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki and the current Oba, Ewuare II, who, as the great-great grandson of the Oba whose palace was ransacked in 1897, argues he is the ‘legitimate custodian’ of everything stolen that year.
In theory, the three Nigerian institutions are united in the idea of building a proposed new museum in Benin City. Governor Obaseki’s vision is ambitious; a world-class museum, designed by the celebrated architect Sir David Adjaye, at an estimated cost of $100-150 million. ""We can make this win-win,"" says governor Obaseki, pointing out that even if some Benin Bronzes remained in Europe and the United States, Benin’s new museum could still have a large collection. Nigeria’s recent history is full of squandered opportunities, and much could go wrong. But, for the first time since 1897, it is the Edo themselves who will play a crucial role in determining what happens next to the Benin Bronzes.

127,Germany Agrees To Return Benin Bronzes To Nigeria Starting ...,https://www.npr.org/2021/04/30/992496264/germany-will-repatriate-benin-bronzes-plundered-from-africa-in-the-19th-century,"Germany Will Repatriate Benin Bronzes, Plundered From Africa In The 19th Century
German officials say they have reached an agreement with Nigeria to return a share of plundered artifacts known as Benin Bronzes.
Thousands of plaques and sculptures were looted from the ancient Kingdom of Benin — now southern Nigeria, not the modern nation of Benin — by British soldiers in an 1897 raid, and were ultimately acquired by museums largely in Europe and the United States.
For the last decade, a consortium known as the Benin Dialogue Group has been working to repatriate these works and establish a permanent display in Benin City, in partnership with museums in Germany and other European nations. German officials announced on Thursday that they will work with Nigeria on plans to return some of its Benin Bronzes in the year ahead.
""The participants are in agreement that addressing Germany's colonial past is an important issue for the whole of society and a core task for cultural policy,"" they wrote in a joint release.
The German officials aim to return the first of their Benin Bronzes next year, and will release more specific plans and timetables by this summer. They said they ""reaffirm their willingness in principle to make substantial returns"" of the artifacts, but left the door open to keeping some of them.
""Discussions with the Nigerian partners are to cover not only returns to and cooperation projects in Nigeria, but also whether and how Benin Bronzes, as part of humanity's cultural heritage, can in future be shown in Germany as well,"" they said.
Numerous German museums are in possession of Benin Bronzes, the officials said. They invited the ones who are not part of the Benin Dialogue Group to join in their efforts.
There are far more of these historical objects scattered across the globe than in their native country, according to author Dan Hicks. He told Art News that 45 institutions in the United Kingdom and 38 in the U.S. hold Benin Bronzes, compared to just nine in Nigeria.
Berlin's Ethnological Museum is home to one of the world's largest collections of artifacts from the ancient kingdom, as The Associated Press reports. Its inventory is estimated to include some 530 items, including 440 bronzes. And roughly 900 such artifacts are housed in the British Museum alone.
Activists are increasingly calling for cultural institutions to repatriate their Benin Bronzes — widely seen as a symbol of colonial conquest — to Nigeria, though few have actually done so.
The French state promised two years ago to repatriate 26 such artifacts by 2021, but, as Art News reported this month, none has permanently left the country yet.
And while the British government has said institutions should ""retain and explain"" controversial artifacts, some regional U.K. museums appear to disagree, as the Guardian reports.
Scotland's University of Aberdeen announced last month that it would imminently return a bust it had acquired in the 1950s, citing ethical concerns.
""Our panel concluded that this was acquired as loot and therefore, we didn't feel we had moral title,"" said Neil Curtis, head of museums and special collections at the University of Aberdeen.

128,Returned artefacts: Asset or burden? | The Nation Nigeria,https://thenationonlineng.net/returned-artefacts-asset-or-burden/,"The 124 year-old punitive expedition of British Army in Benin Kingdom, resulting in the looting of priceless bronzes, has continued to attract calls for restitution. Last week, museums and institutions in UK and Germany indicated their readiness to return some of these stolen works in collections back to Nigeria. How prepared is Nigeria to fund museums in order to provide adequate space and care for the returned objects, Assistant Editor Arts (Arts) OZOLUA UHAKHEME reports.
The age-long burning issue of repatriation of artifacts stolen from Benin by the British Army during the infamous 1897 punitive expedition seems to be receiving positive responses from Europe where most of these priceless objects are kept.
The British forces looted thousands of metal and ivory sculptures as well as carvings during an invasion of Benin City in 1897. Some of the soldiers and administrators involved sold the artworks to museums, while others were given as gifts to museums or sold at auction or by art dealers.
The University of Aberdeen said last week it will return a Benin Bronze to Nigeria within weeks, one of the first public institutions to do so more than a century after Britain looted the sculptures and auctioned them to Western museums and collectors.
Also, Germany has said it would begin the process of returning hundreds of artefacts from the kingdom, including 440 of the famed Benin Bronzes held at Berlin’s Ethnological Museum.
The moves follow decades of agitation for the return of artefacts that have become global symbols of western plunder during colonialism, and the ill-gotten cultural heritage of colonised peoples displayed in museums around the world. The clamour has grown louder as the Black Lives Matter movement has intensified the spotlight on the ills of colonialism and need for restitution.
However, Africa’s leading art collector and Founder Yemisi Shyllon Museum, Lagos Omooba Yemisi Shyllon is not enthusiastic about the planned return of the priceless objects saying the general attitudes of Nigerians do not favour the return of the objects. He said Nigeria lacks the capacity; human resources, technological advancement and attitudes to house and care for the objects the same way the objects have been cared for by different galleries, museums and institutions in Europe and America. He said most Nigerians do not love the works as they tag them demonic.
“I am speaking about the ethnographic and archeological works in the museums, which are not appreciated by Nigerians. Since 75 years when the first museum was established in the country, how has Nigeria funded the museums across the country? We have consistently dished out messages portraying these works as demonic and that they won’t allow many to go to heaven.
“We do not have carbon dating equipment, the human capacity to preserve these works, no adequate allocation of funds to the different museums across the country and our people believe that the works contain evil spirits. Unfortunately, the world is moving from physical to virtual in the transaction of almost every business. How have we invested in the development of the physical museums since 1945? How prepared are we to invest in virtual that is IT driven?” Shyllon asked.
He feared that when the works are returned, they will be kept in non-conducive state and will not receive the quality care they are currently getting now.
To him, rather than return the works to Nigeria, ‘we should enter into agreement with those institutions, galleries and museums reaffirming that those works belong to us, and as such they should pay royalty for keeping them until we are prepared to house the works. Such agreement, he said, should be renewable every 20 years and our preparedness should be monitored by a UN agency.’
One of Nigeria’s modern artists and trustee of Legacy Restoration Trust, Mr. Victor Ehikhamenor shared a different view. He said in a report that he hoped the decision to return the stolen objects would prompt others to follow suit. “Because some of these things are missing from our environment, people are not able to contextualise where we are coming from,” Ehikhamenor said.
The plans for a new museum in Benin City will in part answer the argument long made in the West that developing countries do not have the facilities to keep the priceless art safe, Ehikhamenor dismissed the premise.
“If somebody comes to your house and steals one of your heirlooms, it would be a bit disingenuous for them to then turn around and ask you, what are you going to do with this?
“It’s like going to Buckingham Palace, ripping the paintings off the walls and when the owners question the intruders, they would ask if the original owners are sure they can take care of them,” he noted.
“This is a major institutional return and an entire country finding the right language and having the conscious mind to do the right thing,” he added.
Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed described the release of the bronze work as a right step in the right direction. “The reaching out by the University of Aberdeen and eventual release of the priceless antiquity is a step in the right direction,” the institution quoted him as saying. “Other holders of Nigerian antiquity ought to emulate this to bring fairness to the burning issue of repatriation”.
Professor of Painting and Art History, University of Calabar, Prof. Victor Ecoma University of Calabar, shared similar view points of Shyllon. He said he is not sure the NCMM have the capability to retain those artifacts in a conducive museum environment that promotes research, preservation, conservation and restoration. This, he said, is partly due to inadequate budget for the sector not considered a government’s priority. “The issue of light and space requirements will also be a major set-back. Since the 1950s the national museum has not had any expansion to meet its space needs,” he added.
According to him, the drive to return looted artifacts is largely a moral burden on the West and to avoid any form of reparations. “They have also argued that it is a way of ensuring a non repeat of looting artifacts in crisis situations. Also due to globalisation the era of artistic colonisation is coming to an end,” he said.
The restitutions will increase the pressure on London’s British Museum, which holds about 900 Benin artifacts. The museum this week acknowledged the “devastation and plunder wreaked upon Benin City during the British military expedition in 1897” but did not offer to return them.
In a report, the University of Aberdeen said that the sculpture of an Oba, or ruler, of the Kingdom of Benin, had left Nigeria in an “extremely immoral” fashion, leading it to reach out to authorities in 2019 to negotiate its return.
Pressure has mounted to return to their places of origin the Benin Bronzes – actually copper alloy relief sculptures – and other artifacts taken by colonial powers.
Neil Curtis, Aberdeen’s head of museums and special collections, said the Bronze, purchased in 1957, had been “blatantly looted” 124 years ago by British soldiers.
“It became clear we had to do something,” Curtis said.
Britain’s soldiers seized thousands of metal castings and sculptures from the Kingdom of Benin, then separate from British-ruled Nigeria, in 1897.
The university called it “one of the most notorious examples of the pillaging of cultural treasures associated with 19th-century European colonial expansion”.
“It would not have been right to have retained an item of such great cultural importance that was acquired in such reprehensible circumstances,” said university vice-chancellor George Boyne.
The move was also backed by Aberdeen University’s governing body and the Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the school, Prof. George Boyne, said the development is in line with the values of the institution.
“This is in line with our values as an international, inclusive university and our foundational purpose of being open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others,” the school quoted him as saying.
“It would not have been right to have retained an item of such great cultural importance that was acquired in such reprehensible circumstances. We, therefore, decided that an unconditional return is the most appropriate action we can take, and are grateful for the close collaboration with our partners in Nigeria.”
According to the school, it started the conversation for the return of the artwork through Prof Bankole Sodipo, Professor of Law in Babcock University, with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments through its Legal Adviser, Babatunde Adebiyi, the Edo State Government through the then Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof Yinka Omorogbe and the Royal Court of the Oba of Benin through Prince Prof Gregory Akenzua in 2020.
Director-General National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), Prof Abba Isa Tijani said the importance of displaying the bronze inside Nigeria for the first time in more than 120 years was inexpressible. “It is part of our identity, part of our heritage, which has been taken away from us for many years,” Tijani said.
On the new wave of desire to return the objects to Nigeria, the former Provost Federal College of Education (Special) Osiele, Abeokuta, Dr. Kunle Filani noted that the European museums and galleries have been conscientised over the years especially with the recent protests of Black Lives Matter. “They are realising that the continuing keeping of the looted bronzes puts them in an immoral conundrum. I am sure that they will make replicas of the bronzes before returning them… this should not be permitted because it is still immoral and pejorative to the African consciousness,” he added.
The British Museum, which holds hundreds of the sculptures, has alongside several other museums formed a Benin Dialogue Group to discuss displaying them in Benin City. It has said discussions are ongoing.
The University of Cambridge’s Jesus College said it had finalised approvals in December to return one Bronze. Tijani said US museums would also return two more Bronzes.
The governor of Edo state, of which Benin City is the capital, plans to build a centre to store and study the returned artifacts by the end of 2021, and a permanent museum by 2025.
“The strength of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time — whether through trade, migration, conquest, or peaceful exchange,” the museum said.
Dan Hicks, author of The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution, said the statement read like “something out of the 19th century”.
“It’s hard to understand how that narrative really remains, and [how] anyone can say it with a straight face in the 21st century,” he said.
The Benin Bronzes are a series of exquisite sculptures of animals, people and the kingdom’s rulers, dating from at least the 16th century. Many were commissioned specifically for sacred ritual use. They also include plaques that tell the story of the kingdom that once lined its royal palace. Oba Ewuare II, the current king, has led efforts to recover the bronzes, including a request made during a visit from the British Museum in 2018.
Barnaby Phillips, author of Loot: Britain and the Benin Bronzes, highlighted the role played by the 1963 British Museum Act, which prohibits restitution.
“I’m not saying by any means that the British Museum is desperate to return the Benin Bronzes — it’s not,” said Phillips, a former BBC correspondent in Nigeria. “[But] it is very difficult for the British Museum to give back objects in its collections short of a new law.”
Hicks estimated that 99 per cent of African objects in UK museums taken under colonialism are in storage boxes, some of which “haven’t been opened for 100 years”.",,2021-03-31,124 year old punitive

130,Germany To Return Looted Benin Bronzes To Nigeria - The ...,https://www.theculturenewspaper.com/germany-to-return-looted-benin-bronzes-to-nigeria/,"Precious artifacts looted during the colonial era will finally be returned to Nigeria, the German government has announced.
A report monitored on CNN states that the first set of works to be returned are planned for 2022.
In a joint declaration published last Thursday, Germany’s Ministry of Culture, state ministers and museum directors are now committed to “substantive returns” of Benin bronzes – artworks made of bronze, brass and ivory that were taken by the British army in a raid on the Kingdom of Benin, in present-day Nigeria, in 1897.
The bronzes were subsequently distributed across the world and hundreds are currently held in German museums. Nigeria has sought their return for decades.
A historian and researcher at Nigeria’s Institute for Benin Studies, Osaisonor Godfrey Ekhator-Obogie, welcomed the declaration, saying that Germany is “leading in the global restitution movement.”
“Other European nations should be willing and open to acknowledge that all objects looted in 1897 belong to the Benin people,” he said via email. “Like Germany, they too should initiate or join the dialogue to discuss the future of these objects.
“This decision was a truce with parties, not a win-win or winner takes it all. I will tell my children about this historic moment.”
German Culture Minister, Monika Grütters described the declaration as a “historic milestone.”
“We face a historic and moral responsibility to shine a light on Germany’s colonial past,” said Grütters in a statement. “We would like to contribute to an understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of the people who were robbed of their cultural treasures during the colonial era.”
The declaration lays out plans for the first pieces to be returned next year, and for a roadmap to guide additional restitution, without specifying which artifacts or how many.
It also requires museums in possession of Benin objects to establish and document their provenance. Those details are to be to be published on a new website that will serve as an information resource and point of contact for restitution claims relating to any German “collections from colonial contexts.”",,2021-05-03,precious artifact loot colonial era finally return nigeria german government announce report monitor cnn state first set work return plan 2022 joint declaration publish last thursday germany ministry culture state minister museum director commit substantive return benin bronze – artwork make bronze brass ivory take british army raid kingdom benin present day nigeria 1897 bronze subsequently distribute across world hundred currently held german museum nigeria sought return decade historian researcher nigeria institute benin study osaisonor godfrey ekhator obogie welcome declaration say germany lead global restitution movement other european nation willing open acknowledge object loot 1897 belong benin people say via email like germany initiate join dialogue discus future object this decision truce party win win winner take all tell child historic moment german culture minister monika grütters described declaration historic milestone we face historic moral responsibility shine light germany colonial past say grütters statement we would like contribute understand reconciliation descendant people robbed cultural treasure colonial era declaration lay plan first piece return next year roadmap guide additional restitution without specify artifact many also require museum possession benin object establish document provenance detail publish new website serve information resource point contact restitution claim relate german collection colonial context,preciou artifact loot coloni era final return nigeria german govern announc report monitor cnn state first set work return plan 2022 joint declar publish last thursday germani ministri cultur state minist museum director commit substant return benin bronz – artwork made bronz brass ivori taken british armi raid kingdom benin present day nigeria 1897 bronz subsequ distribut across world hundr current held german museum nigeria sought return decad historian research nigeria institut benin studi osaisonor godfrey ekhat obogi welcom declar say germani lead global restitut movement other european nation will open acknowledg object loot 1897 belong benin peopl said via email like germani initi join dialogu discuss futur object thi decis truce parti win win winner take all tell children histor moment german cultur minist monika grütter describ declar histor mileston we face histor moral respons shine light germani coloni past said grütter statement we would like contribut understand reconcili descend peopl rob cultur treasur coloni era declar lay plan first piec return next year roadmap guid addit restitut without specifi artifact mani also requir museum possess benin object establish document proven detail publish new websit serv inform resourc point contact restitut claim relat german collect coloni context
131,Africa's cultural heritage and case for restitution - New Telegraph,https://www.newtelegraphng.com/africas-cultural-heritage-and-case-for-restitution/,"The imperative of increasing global calls and debates for the restitution and repatriation of looted art to Nigeria, more specifically the renowned Benin bronzes, among other related issues, formed kernel of discourse at the 7th edition of ‘Point of View’ (POV), a monthly series of talks interrogating the evolving role of the visual arts in addressing major issues affecting Africa and the rest of the world.
An initiative of The Ben Enwonwu Foundation, organised in collaboration with the Society of Nigerian Artists and supported by Alliance Française /Mike Adenuga Centre Lagos and Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos, the 7th Edition of ‘Point of View’, held 25 May, 2021, and themed ‘Africa’s Cultural Heritage and the Case for Restitution’, lent a voice to increasing global calls and debates for the restitution and repatriation of looted art to Nigeria, more specifically the renowned Benin bronzes.
The talks also discussed current efforts in this direction, the role of African museums and Nigeria’s state of preparedness in receiving and preserving them. In addition, the edition focused on colonialism’s destructive impact on Nigerian cultural heritage, diaspora affairs, migration and the reinvention of identity.
There were presentations on ‘Imperialism, Art and the Case for Restitution’ by Prof Peju Layiwola, Department of Creative Arts, University of Lagos; and ‘The British Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution’, by Dan Hicks FSA, Professor of Contemporary Archaeology, University of Oxford. ‘The Restitution Debate: Diaspora Affairs, Migration and the Reinvention of Identity’ was the focus of the panel discussion moderated by the Assistant Curator, Center for Contemporary Art, Lagos, Peter Okotor.
The panel comprises Director/Founder, African Artists Foundation (AAF), Azu Nwagbogu; Director, Institut Français de Recheche en Afrique (Nigeria), University of Ibadan, Dr Vincent Hiribarren; and President, Legacy 1995, Kofo Adeleke.
In an interview with New Telegraph, the President of Society of Nigerian Artists (SNA) and founder/ executive director, and trustee of The Ben Enwonwu Foundation, Mr. Oliver Enwonwu, underscored the need to increase the agitation for the repatriation and restitution of her looted artefacts. “As Africa comes into her own as a continent with her peoples negotiating their identity, it has become more imperative to increase the agitation for the repatriation and restitution of her looted artefacts. In addition, the talks question the state of museums in the continent and their current role in preserving existing artefacts in their collection as well as their state of preparedness in receiving those from Western museums and institutions,” he said.
Highlights of the event include screening of ‘Rawson’s Boat’ by multimedia performance artist and sculptor, Jelili Atiku. The event was supported by the Society of Nigerian Artists, Alliance Française Lagos, Centre for Contemporary Art Lagos, Toff Resources Nigeria Ltd, CIL Acquico Ltd, Jelili Atiku Foundation, Five Cowries Art Education, Jackson, Etti & Edu, Vanguard, Ventures Platform, Business- Day, Connect Nigeria, TSA Contemporary Art Magazine, EKO Trends, Environews Nigeria, The Lagos Weekender, The Sole Adventurer, WildflowerPR and Omenka. Launched on September 17, 2019, ‘Point of View’ (POV) draws from other creative disciplines and such diverse sectors as government, science and technology, to impact policy by raising awareness, advocating for change and inspiring action. It aims to further encourage support and funding for visual artists through public and private sector partnership while ensuring continuing artists’ professional development and empowerment.
The Ben Enwonwu Foundation (BEF) was established in 2003 in honour of celebrated Nigerian artist, scholar, educator, art administrator and statesman, Professor Benedict Chukwukadibia Enwonwu MBE, NNOM (1917-94). Amongst many other accomplish-ments, Enwonwu was the first Nigerian artist to gain international recognition. Conferred in 1954 with the Member of the distinguished order of the British Empire, he remains the only Black artist to have been commissioned to sculpt Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. In Nigeria, Enwonwu was also the first professor of art and first federal art adviser.
Widely acclaimed as Africa’s pioneer modernist artist and one of the greatest in the world, he is credited with laying the philosophical foundations of contemporary African art by fusing Western techniques and conventions with indigenous traditions and aesthetics — his over 60 years career embracing a broad range of socio-political and economic movements, philosophies and themes including Pan Africanism, Negritude, identity, the body (the gaze), gender equality, spirituality and religion, peace and conflict resolution. According to Oliver, the Foundation aims to sustain and build on his life’s work through a three-pronged approach to: promote, foster, explain, protect and give prestige to, in Nigeria and globally, his artistic, intellectual and political legacy by such acts as the publishing of a catalogue raisonne in volumes, of his total creative output, and the managing, defending and administering of the intangible rights derived from his work and person; maintain a diverse multi-disciplinary public programme of exhibitions, projects, workshops, talks and lectures that explores in a research-minded way, Enwonwu’s oeuvre while increasing the visibility and appreciation of art from the African continent, and brings together professionals across such diverse sectors as the arts, government, science and technology, to advocate for change, proffer solutions and impact policy in addressing major issues affecting Africa and the rest of the world.
“On-going initiatives in this regard are the ‘Ben Enwonwu Distinguished Lecture Series’ and ‘Point of View’ (POV), held in partnership with Alliance Francaise Lagos/ Mike Adenuga Centre. Both foster public understanding of the relevance of the visual arts to socio-economic advancement.
Begun in 2004, the series features national and international leaders, renowned thinkers and key policy makers as speakers. Launched in 2019 as a monthly interdisciplinary talks platform, ‘Point of View’, in addition, encourages artists’ professional development while canvasing for public-private funding for the visual arts.
“As part of its year-round educational programme, BEF’s scholarship scheme benefits second year students of the finest tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The Foundation also supports publications and research exploring the cultural and social context of Enwonwu’s art.
Located along with the Foundation in the artist’s home, which lends to its historical and cultural significance, leading gallery, Omenka, represents an exceptional selection of artists whose work in varying media resonates strongly with the African continent and her related diaspora.” The Foundation aims to promote cross-cultural ties and exchange between established and emerging artists, designers and curators, through international residencies that nurture new forms and ideas, build networks and provide mentoring opportunities and possibilities for collaborative

132,Le Met va rendre au Nigeria deux bronzes pillés au XIXe siècle,https://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/le-met-va-rendre-au-nigeria-deux-bronzes-pilles-au-xixe-siecle-20210611,"Le Met va rendre au Nigeria deux bronzes pillés au XIXe siècle
Deux de ces objets avaient déjà été rendus en 1950 avant de s'y volatiliser. L'ensemble pourrait être exposé au grand musée d'art et d'histoire en construction à Benin City.
Ce n'est sans doute pas la dernière restitution à prévoir. Le Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) a annoncé mercredi rendre au Nigeria trois objets anciens de sa collection : deux plaques en bronze du royaume du Bénin, datées du XVIe siècle, ainsi qu'une tête en laiton de la cité-État d'Ife, datée du XIVe siècle environ. Cette décision fait suite à des discussions menées conjointement avec le British Museum et la Commission nationale des musées du Nigeria, a précisé le Met, qui a retiré les objets de ses galeries et les a dessaisis de son inventaire. Les trois bronzes attendent désormais d'être récupérés à New York par une délégation nigériane.

Les trois objets n'ont pas été choisis au hasard, mais en raison de leur récent parcours frauduleux. Exposées depuis trente ans au Met, les deux plaques en bronze restituées faisaient partie de la collection de 131 objets d'art africains donnée en 1991 au musée new-yorkais par le marchand d'art Klaus Perls (1912-2008). Un siècle avant cette donation, cependant, ces pièces appartenaient aux quelque 900 plaques qui ornaient le palais royal d'Edo (actuel Benin City, au Nigeria) : pillées en 1897 lors de la mise à sac du site par des troupes britanniques, elles ont été disséminées en Europe puis dans le monde, au sein de grands musées, comme le British Museum, à Londres ou le Weltmuseum de Vienne. Conservées jusqu'en 1950 entre les murs du grand musée britannique, les deux plaques du Met restituées mercredi avaient déjà été rendues en 1950-1951 au musée national du Nigeria, avec 24 autres objets, avant de disparaître dans des circonstances floues puis de refaire surface sur le marché de l'art new-yorkais. Le troisième objet - la tête en laiton - avait quant à lui été frauduleusement vendu au musée.
Comme l'explique le Metropolitan Museum, cette restitution s'inscrit dans la démarche d'une meilleure prise en considération du parcours de certains objets de ses collections. Le musée, qui continue d'exposer plus d'une centaine de pièces liées au pillage du patrimoine africain, et notamment du royaume du Bénin, a travaillé à la mise à jour de ses collections numériques et de ses différents espaces de médiation afin de mieux mettre en valeur ces objets et leur histoire. «Le Met est heureux d'avoir pris l'initiative du retour de ces œuvres et s'engage à être transparent et responsable dans sa collection des biens culturels», a fait savoir le musée dans un communiqué publié mercredi. Aussi symbolique soit-il - le Met possède quelque 160 objets provenant du seul pillage du palais d'Edo -, ce premier geste n'a pas manqué d'être salué par les autorités nigérianes proches du dossier.

«Nous apprécions sincèrement la transparence dont a fait preuve le Metropolitan Museum of Art concernant les questions ayant conduit au retour de ces objets», a ainsi indiqué le directeur de la Commission nationale des musées du Nigeria, Abba Isa Tijani, qui est attendu prochainement à New York pour y recevoir les bronzes restitués. «Nous nous félicitons du rapprochement qui s'opère dans le monde des musées et apprécions le sens de la justice dont fait preuve le Metropolitan Museum of Art, a également salué le ministre nigérian de l'Information et de la Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed. Le Nigeria invite les autres musées à s'en inspirer. Le monde de l'art peut être meilleur si chaque détenteur d'objets culturels prend en compte les droits et les sentiments des personnes dépossédées». Interrogé par le New York Times au sujet de l'éventuel retour des autres objets du royaume du Bénin conservés entre ses murs, le Met s'est contenté de répondre qu'aucune autre restitution supplémentaire n'était pour l'heure envisagée.
Multiplication des restitutions
Un mouvement international de restitution d'objets historiques africains a le vent en poupe ces dernières années. En Allemagne, l'inauguration du Humboldt Forum avait provoqué un vif débat public au sujet de l'importante collection de bronzes du Bénin conservée par les musées de Berlin. Un tournant dans l'attitude du gouvernement allemand, des «restitutions substantielles» ont en fin de compte été annoncées le mois dernier. Même son de cloche aux Pays-Bas, où le gouvernement a décidé, en février, de mettre en place un comité pour vérifier la provenance des objets conservés au sein de collections qui auraient été «injustement» constituées pendant l'époque coloniale. «En raison du déséquilibre des pouvoirs à l'époque coloniale, les objets culturels étaient - de fait - souvent volés», avait reconnu le gouvernement néerlandais au début de l'année. En France, la remise du rapport des historiens Bénédicte Savoy et Felwine Sarr en 2018 n'a pour l'heure abouti qu'à la restitution - d'ici la fin de l'année - de 26 objets au Bénin.
Signe que la mobilisation gagne aussi les pays africains, plusieurs projets de musées modernes sont aujourd'hui en chantier autour du golfe de Guinée. Au Nigeria, à Benin City, un grand musée d'art et d'histoire, dessiné par l'architecte britanno-ghanéen David Adjaye, devrait voir le jour en 2025, avec l'espoir affiché d'y exposer le patrimoine du royaume du Bénin conservé à l'étranger. Au Bénin, un musée de l'épopée des Amazones et des rois du Danhomè est également en chantier à Abomey, où il est construit en partenariat avec la France. L'engagement des États européens pour la restitution d'au moins une partie des collections constituées en contexte colonial reste en revanche très variable d'un pays à l'autre. La direction du British Museum, en particulier, se refuse jusqu'à présent à évoquer la moindre restitution parmi les 900 objets du royaume Bénin. Une inflexibilité qui ne concerne pas que les objets extra-européens, comme l'a encore rappelé le Premier ministre britannique Boris Johnson qui avait écarté, en mars, l'éventuelle restitution des marbres du Parthénon.",,2021-06-11,met rendre nigeria deux bronze pillés xixe siècle deux ce objets avaient déjà été rendus 1950 avant sy volatiliser lensemble pourrait être exposé grand musée dart

Benin-Bronzen: Politik plant ab 2022 ""substantielle Rückgaben""
Bis zum Sommer wollen Bund und die betroffenen Länder entscheiden, wann und welche Kunstwerke an Nigeria zurückgegeben werden. Dazu sollen die Verhandlungen ""intensiviert"" werden, außerdem wird ""größtmögliche Transparenz"" versprochen.
Der Druck wächst: Jahrzehntelang spielten deutsche Museen ""auf Zeit"" und ließen die Debatte über die Rückgabe von Kunstobjekten, die einst aus Afrika geraubt wurden, ins Leere laufen. Im Fall der Benin-Bronzen, wertvollen Metalltafeln und Skulpturen aus dem einstigen gleichnamigen Königreich im heutigen Nigeria, hieß es offiziell, die Objekte seien auf dem Kunstmarkt in London um 1900 nach damaligem Recht völlig legal erworben worden. Das traf rein juristisch zu, denn den Raubzug hatten britische Soldaten zu verantworten, die 1897 bei einem ""Rachefeldzug"" Benin-City überrannt und tausende von Kunstgegenständen entwendet hatten. Die kostbaren Bronzen wurden dann über Londons Kunsthandel zu Geld gemacht.
Deutschland will Museums-Aufbau in Benin-City unterstützen
Bei einem virtuellen Treffen der verantwortlichen Politiker, darunter Bundeskulturstaatsministerin Monika Grütters und den zuständigen Landesministern von Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg, Nordrhein-Westfalen und Sachsen, wo die betroffenen Museen angesiedelt sind, wurde nun ein ""Positionspapier"" beschlossen. Ergebnis: Alle Beteiligten wollen ""bis zum Sommer dieses Jahres konkrete Handlungsschritte und einen Fahrplan für die Frage der Rückführung von Benin-Bronzen"" entwickeln und 2022 erste Objekte zurückgeben. Außerdem will Deutschland den Aufbau des ""Edo Museum of West African Art"" (EMOWAA) in Benin-City aktiv unterstützen: ""Hierzu zählen unter anderem die Ausbildung zukünftiger Kuratorinnen und Kuratoren, Museumsmanagerinnen und Museumsmanager sowie der Aufbau kultureller Infrastrukturen.""

Sklavenhandel: Historische Benin-Bronze
Allerdings will die Politik auch ausloten, welche Objekte dauerhaft in Deutschland bleiben können: ""Neben Rückgaben an und Kooperationsprojekten in Nigeria soll mit den nigerianischen Partnern auch erörtert werden, ob und wie Benin-Bronzen als Teil des kulturellen Erbes der Menschheit künftig ebenfalls in Deutschland gezeigt werden können.""
""Verständigung und Versöhnung"" angestrebt
Kulturstaatsministerin Monika Grütters sieht sich in ihren Zielen bestätigt: ""Wir stellen uns der historischen und moralischen Verantwortung, Deutschlands koloniale Vergangenheit ans Licht zu holen und aufzuarbeiten. Der Umgang mit den Benin-Bronzen ist dafür ein Prüfstein. Die heute verabschiedete Erklärung ist eine historische Wegmarke im Umgang mit der kolonialen Vergangenheit."" Sie sei ""froh und dankbar"", dass sich die Beteiligten auf das ""gemeinsame Ziel verständigen konnten, eine abgestimmte Haltung in Deutschland zu entwickeln und zu einer gemeinsamen Verständigung mit der nigerianischen Seite zu gelangen"". Dabei würden neben ""größtmöglicher Transparenz"" vor allem ""substantielle Rückgaben"" angestrebt: ""So möchten wir zur Verständigung und zur Versöhnung mit den Nachkommen der Menschen beitragen, die in der Zeit des Kolonialismus ihrer kulturellen Schätze beraubt wurden. Wir planen erste Rückgaben im Verlauf des Jahres 2022.""
Bis Mitte Juni soll ""kurzfristig eine Aufstellung aller im Besitz der Museen befindlichen Benin-Bronzen"" im Netz (www.cp3c.de) veröffentlicht werden. Von deutscher Seite sollen die Gespräche der Bundesregierung auf der Seite der Museen und ihrer Träger durch die Direktorin des Museums am Rothenbaum Kulturen und Künste der Welt (MARKK) Hamburg, Prof. Barbara Plankensteiner, und den Präsidenten der Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz (SPK) Prof. Hermann Parzinger, koordiniert werden.
""Zugestanden wir nur, was man nicht verweigern kann""
Bundesaußenminister Heiko Maas (SPD) begrüßte die Einigung: ""Dass es jetzt gelungen ist, mit den Museen und ihren Trägern einen Fahrplan für Restitutionen von Objekten zu vereinbaren, ist ein Wendepunkt in unserem Umgang mit der Kolonialgeschichte. Und wir werden gemeinsam mit den nigerianischen Partnern Lösungen finden.""
Der Historiker und Afrikawissenschaftler Jürgen Zimmerer hat gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur dpa die jüngste Einigung zu Rückgaben von Benin-Bronzen als enttäuschend kritisiert: ""So erfreulich das einmütige Bekenntnis zur substanziellen Restitution ist, so enttäuschend ist das Ergebnis des Benin-Gipfels insgesamt."" Es werde lediglich verkündet, ""was in den letzten Jahren immer wieder verkündet, aber nicht mit Leben gefüllt wurde"". Statt ""bedingungsloser Verpflichtung zur Rückgabe von Raubkunst"" sei nur vage von einem ""substantiellen Teil» die Rede. Wie dieser bestimmt werde und wer ihn bestimme, werde nicht gesagt, kritisierte Zimmerer: ""Zugestanden wird nur, was man nicht mehr verweigern kann, zumindest bei einer Mehrheit der Verantwortlichen.""

Prächtig wie aus der Renaissance: Büste aus Benin-City
Berlins Kultursenator Klaus Lederer (Die Linke) knüpfte Bedingungen an weitere Ausstellungen der als Raubgut geltenden Benin-Bronzen in Deutschland: ""Eine Präsentation von Benin-Bronzen etwa im Humboldt Forum kann ich mir nur vorstellen, wenn zuvor die umfassende rechtliche Restitution der Bronzen erfolgt ist. Für Leihgaben, die es ermöglichen könnten, diese Meisterwerke auch in Berlin erleben zu können, müssten wir außerordentlich dankbar sein.""
Kritikerin: Museen setzten auf ""retardierende Maßnahmen""
Im NDR ""Kulturjournal"" hatte die Kunsthistorikerin Bénédicte Savoy erst in dieser Woche ihre Kritik wiederholt, die betroffenen Museen hätten auf Verzögerungstaktik gesetzt, indem sie zum Beispiel die Kulturministerkonferenz eingeschaltet hätten, die für ihre Langsamkeit bekannt sei: ""Eine Methode war zum Beispiel, zu sagen, wenn wir etwas zurückgeben müssen, betrifft das die gesamte Bundesrepublik, deshalb müssen wir die höheren Instanzen anrufen. Das nennen sie untereinander eine 'retardierende Maßnahme', Zeit gewinnen.""
Savoy, die gerade mit ihrem Buch ""Afrikas Kampf um seine Kunst: Geschichte einer postkolonialen Niederlage"" für Furore sorgt, warf den westlichen Museumsverantwortlichen außerdem Arroganz gegenüber den Herkunftsländern der Kunstobjekte vor: ""Sie sagten, die Leute in diesen Ländern haben ja keine Ahnung von ihrer eigenen Kultur, sie können das gar nicht, sie haben keine Wertschätzung dafür, sie benutzen das nur, und wir haben es für die Menschheit gerettet, damit die Menschheit weiß, wie eine Benin-Bronze ausgesehen hat.""
Der Präsident der Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Hermann Parzinger, hatte diese Vorwürfe im Gespräch mit dem BR im Großen und Ganzen bestätigt, was frühere Museumschefs betrifft: ""Natürlich war vor vierzig Jahren die Haltung eine andere von deutschen und europäischen Museumsverantwortlichen. Das war für die ein Thema, da wollte man nicht ran, das hat man abgeblockt, für die war das klar. Auch mit Argumenten, die man heute keinesfalls mehr teilen würde, nach dem Motto, das würde dem neuen Nationalismus in den jungen, afrikanischen Staaten in die Hände spielen, sie könnten sich um die Objekte ja gar nicht kümmern, solche Argumente würde man heute keinesfalls mehr vorbringen.""

L’Allemagne prévoit de restituer au Nigeria à partir de 2022 des sculptures désignées comme “bronzes du Bénin” issues de pillages remontant à l’époque coloniale, a annoncé jeudi soir la secrétaire d’État à la Culture Monika Grütters.
Cette décision a été prise lors d’une réunion entre:
- Experts de musées et responsables politiques nationaux et régionaux organisée à l’initiative de Monika Grütters.
“Nous voulons contribuer à la compréhension et à la réconciliation avec les descendants de ceux dont les trésors culturels ont été dérobés pendant la colonisation”, a-t-elle indiqué dans un communiqué.
“Nous prévoyons les premières restitutions au cours de l’année 2022”, a-t-elle ajouté.
Les musées devront d’ici au 15 juin publier une liste détaillée de l’ensemble des bronzes en leur possession. Une nouvelle réunion fin juin devra déterminer le calendrier des restitutions.
Cette décision constitue “un tournant dans notre rapport à notre histoire coloniale”. A estimé le chef de la diplomatie allemande Heiko Maas dans un communiqué.
Les bronzes du Bénin figurent parmi les artefacts les plus réputés de l’art africain. Ces plaques, avec leurs bustes et sculptures en laiton. Fabriquées entre le XVIe et le XVIIIe siècle, décoraient le palais royal du Royaume du Bénin. Dans ce qui est aujourd’hui le sud-ouest du Nigeria.
Elles avaient été réparties dans plusieurs musées européens. En effet, après le pillage du pays par les Britanniques à la fin du XIXe siècle.
Diplomatie culturelle commençons par les Bronzes du Benin
Il s’agit d’une évolution très appréciée qui établira une nouvelle norme mondiale en matière de diplomatie culturelle. Je voudrais remercier tous ceux qui ont rendu cela possible au sein du gouvernement allemand. Ainsi que les professionnels des musées et la société civile.
Le musée ethnographique du Forum Humboldt de Berlin, qui devrait accueillir cette année ses premiers visiteurs après une rénovation complète, possède environ 530 objets historiques dont plus de 400 bronzes issus de l’ancien Royaume du Bénin. Cette collection est présentée comme la plus importante du genre après celle du British Museum de Londres.
La réouverture du Forum Humboldt, sur la célèbre île aux Musées, s’est accompagnée d’une vive controverse. En effet, sur l’opportunité d’exposer de telles œuvres. L’ambassadeur du Nigeria en Allemagne, Yusuf Tuggar, avait à cette occasion demandé leur restitution.
“Une approche sincère de l’histoire coloniale inclut également la question de la restitution des biens culturels”. Avait déclaré fin mars Heiko Maas.
En Europe, la plupart des anciennes puissances coloniales ont lancé ces dernières années des réflexions sur la réappropriation de leur patrimoine par les anciens pays colonisés, surtout africains.
En effet, le British Museum s’est prononcé pour un retour de certaines œuvres au Nigeria, mais sous la forme de prêt.
Le Nigeria veut construire un nouveau musée pour exposer les précieux bronzes. Le futur bâtiment devrait sortir de terre à la fin 2024 à Benin City (État d’Edo). Cela à partir d’un financement initial de 3,4 millions d’euros, auquel participe le British Museum. Fin 2020, la France a approuvé la restitution de 26 pièces pillées en 1892 dans l’ancien Royaume du Bénin.

A new exhibition examines the pioneering ethnographic archive assembled by Britain’s first colonial anthropologist, Cambridge alumnus Northcote Thomas.

An astonishing collection of African artwork collected during Britain’s first anthropological surveys of early 20th-Century West Africa is to go on display for the very first time at Cambridge’s Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology (MAA). The exhibition also features photographic portraits, archival materials and contemporary artistic responses from Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
In this politically- and emotionally-charged exhibition, the curators pose difficult questions about the nature of colonialism at the time and its legacies today.
[Re:] Entanglements: Colonial collections in decolonial times (22 June 2021 – 17 April 2022), is the culmination of the AHRC-funded Museum Affordances project led by Professor Paul Basu at SOAS University of London alongside Dr George Agbo of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and involving multiple partnerships in West Africa, the UK and beyond.
The project seeks to re-engage with the ethnographic archive assembled by the University of Cambridge-educated colonial anthropologist, Northcote Whitridge Thomas (1868-1936) in Southern Nigeria and Sierra Leone between 1909 and 1915.
The ‘Thomas Collection’ includes masks, drums, carved wooden figures and staffs, pottery, textiles, charms, dolls, photographs, sound recordings, botanical specimens, published work and field notes.
Northcote Thomas (pictured, c.1909-10) may be largely unknown today but this exhibition argues that his work and collection are more relevant and provocative than ever.
Thomas was known as a difficult and eccentric character, and while the Colonial Office in London initially supported his experimental work, colonial governments in West Africa viewed it as unwanted interference.
Curator Professor Paul Basu says: “They didn't take kindly to some academic telling them they should pay respect to local leaders. At the same time, Thomas didn’t do himself any favours – he alienated the colonial administration.
“It’s clear from Thomas’ correspondence that he had much less patience with colonial bureaucracy than he did with his local interlocutors. While the colonial government saw African power structures as arcane, he saw logic in them. Thomas was sympathetic to local ways of doing things and he took the magico-religious basis on which West African societies were ordered very seriously.”
Northcote Thomas studied history at Trinity College, Cambridge in the 1880s and 90s and was appointed Government Anthropologist by the British Colonial Office in 1909. He mistakenly believed that the British Museum would acquire his collections.
He sent an initial batch of “ethnographic specimens” there in 1909 and planned to send more. However, the then Keeper of Ethnographic Collections, Charles Hercules Read, turned him down writing: “I am by no means sure that I want these modern things made to order as it were…”
Eventually, Thomas offered his collection to his alma mater’s Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology. MAA accepted, reimbursed his expenditure, and provided a budget to continue collecting. Sound recordings from the surveys are now held by the British Library, the botanical specimens are in the Herbarium at Kew, while photographic archives are dispersed in different institutions including MAA, the Royal Anthropological Institute and the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos.
Thomas’ complex legacy
In the 1920s, a new generation of anthropologists sought to reinvent the discipline more narrowly as a social science, and dismissed figures like Thomas as antiquaries. But, as this exhibition reveals, Thomas’ work was remarkably experimental.
Basu says: “Today many anthropologists champion multimedia and multi-sensory approaches but Thomas was doing this a hundred years ago.
“He was collecting and commissioning, but also taking photographs and making sound recordings. He was still working in a broadly evolutionist mode which we find deeply problematic today, but his work was ground-breaking and still affords extraordinary insights.”
Colonial collections in decolonial times
The exhibition opens amid growing debate about the restitution of objects looted from Africa now held by British museums. It is often forgotten, however, that the vast majority of objects came to Britain through other means and have their own complicated stories to tell.
Basu says: “These materials were still assembled in the context of colonial inequalities, of course. The operation of colonial power works in many different ways, but Northcote Thomas purchased from markets and commissioned makers, and the complexity of that relationship needs attention just as the removal of the Benin Bronzes does.”
Highlights of the exhibition include some of the thousands of fieldwork photographs taken by Thomas to capture daily life in Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
The project has managed to share many of these images with the descendants of those photographed.
Basu says: “It’s almost always an occasion of joy and amazement, entangled with ideas about reincarnation. It's not merely a nice thing to have a photograph of your great-grandfather; it is much more profound. It's almost as if the ancestors are speaking across a century.”
A focal point of the exhibition is an Olokun pot that Thomas purchased in Benin City in 1909. Pots of this kind were installed on shrines to the deity Olokun. The pot was probably broken on its long journey to Cambridge where it was soon repaired but poorly. As part of the project, the pot has been dismantled and reconstructed using modern conservation techniques.
For Basu, the pot offers a powerful metaphor for colonial engagement: “Something whole and integrated was, through the colonial project, broken into pieces. The ethnographic museum tried to put it back together but clumsily. One hundred years on, we’re taking it apart again, deconstructing the coloniality, reassembling and offering a gesture of repair. But you will see all the cracks, the evidence of the original violence.”
Alongside the pot visitors will see a modern reproduction cast in brass in Benin City, to instigate a dialogue with the Benin Bronzes looted by British forces in 1897.
Other contemporary works on display will include a series of ten paintings by the Nigerian artist Kelani Abass entitled ‘Colonial Indexicality’.
Responding to photograph albums held by the National Museum in Lagos, the only materials from Thomas’ surveys to remain in Nigeria, they evoke the disintegration and discolouration of the archive, but also the ubiquity of the anthropologist’s numbering systems.
They remind us of how people and their cultural practices were transformed into objects of knowledge by this colonial science.
The bigger picture
Professor Nicholas Thomas, Director and Curator of MAA, says: “There is nothing more important in the work of museums today than opening up world cultures collections - opening them up for reflection and scrutiny, and also for creativity.
“The project that underpins this exhibition has been exhilarating: customary makers and artists in both West Africa and the diaspora in the United Kingdom have been fascinated by the Northcote Thomas archive, the knowledge it preserves, and the unsettling issues it raises. We at MAA are thrilled to be bringing this fertile, stimulating and absolutely contemporary take on major historic collections to our audiences.”
Professor Paul Basu says: “Decolonising museums and archives is very important, and something that absolutely needs to happen. But there can be a tendency to over-simplify. Rather than dismissing these collections as being tainted by colonialism, the exhibition asks that we look at them more closely. How do they shift our understanding of what coloniality was – and is? How might we use these collections to work through the legacies of colonialism today?
“I hope people will be moved by the exhibition to reflect upon the complex ways in which they personally and we, as a society, continue to be entangled in this history.”

They said in a statement that the move was part of a growing trend to return cultural artifacts seized during the colonial era to their places of origin.
Britain’s soldiers seized thousands of metal castings and sculptures in 1897 during a raid on the Kingdom of Benin, then separate from British-ruled Nigeria.
The “bronzes” —- actually copper alloy relief sculptures, many showing court figures —- were auctioned off and then spread among institutions from New Zealand to Germany and the U.S.
The biggest collection was in London.

“In addition to maximum transparency, we primarily aim for substantial restitution,” German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters said in the joint statement issued with the foreign ministry and German museums.
“We want to contribute to a common understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of the people who were robbed of their cultural treasures during the times of colonialism,” Gruetters added.
The Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin has more than 500 historical artifacts from the Kingdom of Benin in its collections, mostly bronzes.
The University of Aberdeen in Scotland said last month it would return a Benin bronze to Nigeria within weeks, one of the first public institutions to do so.
The British Museum, which holds hundreds of the sculptures, has alongside several other museums formed a Benin Dialogue Group to discuss displaying them in Benin City, some officially on loan.
Plans are underway in Edo to build a centre to store and study the returned artifacts by the end of 2021, and a permanent museum by 2025.
The German ministries issued their statement in conjunction with German museums that are part of the Benin Dialogue Group.

140,Nigeria: Benin Bronzes - the Long Journey Home - allAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202106060124.html,"Molemo Moiloa on why African voices need to be heard in the debate over the restitution of looted artefacts
Over the years, the Benin bronzes, many of which are now housed in the British Museum and other European collections, have become a symbol of the broader restitution debate. More significant than items already returned to Africa, such as the Hendrik Witbooi Bible and whip, handed back to Namibia by a Stuttgart museum, or the Omar Tall sword returned to Senegal by France, they are a good starting point to discuss the issue of restitution.
Despite their popularity and the seemingly clear moral case for their return they represent only the very beginning of a long and complex journey to restitution.
The Benin bronzes - a catch-all term for items that include ivory, brass, bone and wood sculptures and carvings - were stolen. They are unquestionably precious to the world and cherished by their own people. This, together with the building of a new museum in Nigeria in which to house them, makes their return inevitable.
In 1897, the British sent 5,000 troops on a murderous march to the palace of Benin City, in what Peju Layiwola, the Nigerian artist and historian, calls the 'Benin massacre'. They razed villages to the ground, killed thousands, sacked the palace and took everything, including 4,000 works of artistic, spiritual, medicinal and genealogical value. According to Zacharys Gundu, the archaeologist, they were taken to be sold in Europe 'to pay for the expenses incurred in removing the king from his stool'.
Now Germany has said it will start to hand back to Nigeria priceless artefacts held in Berlin's Ethnologisches Museum in 2022, following a similar move by France in 2020. In April 2021, the University of Aberdeen said it would repatriate a Benin bronze bought at an 1957 auction. Britain and the United States still retain hundreds of pieces.
The European importance of the bronzes lies primarily in their elegance. They hold a distinct visual power and have played a vital role in changing the assessment of intellectual, technological and artistic development of Africans.
The bronze works in particular are early examples of the complex lost-wax technique, displaying a technical mastery. Today, museums throughout the world value their technical and aesthetic brilliance.
When first encountered in 1910 by Leo Frobenius, the German ethnologist, they were said to be too 'lovely' to have been made by 'this assembly of degenerate and feeble-minded posterity'.
The debate over the return of stolen artefacts currently centres on 'experts' from universities and museums in the global north. While they are vital to the debate, African voices are needed to bring balance. While African voices have been calling for the bronzes' return since they were first taken, with the issue becoming most intense in the 1970s, increasingly they are speaking louder, and to each other, about what needs to be done.
Nana Oforiatta Ayim, the Ghanaian writer, art historian and filmmaker, has pointed to the absurdity of arguments that artefacts taken under colonial control but 'paid for' should not be considered as taken under duress.
The complex power frameworks that decide which artefacts are chosen for restitution are explored by Njoki Ngumi, the Kenyan activist and artist. She points out that the museums which often pick and choose for display from the masses of 'things' that were taken have themselves been unable to accurately catalogue, understand and care for the artefacts. Some remain in crates, unopened since they first arrived in the 20th century. Others have been 'treated' with arsenic and cannot be handled without protective clothing, she says.
Chao Tayiana Maina, the founder of African Digital Heritage, has worked to increase access to African cultural heritage. Her work reminds us that there are heaps of records, archives, fundamental knowledge of our history that remain locked away in European basements.
Wazi Apoh, the archaeologist and cultural heritage specialist, has written about what it will take to reclaim not just the physical, tangible objects, but the historical, spiritual and social knowledge around them that is vital to the restitution of African life.
For Felwine Sarr, the Senegalese academic, and Bénédicte Savoy, the French scholar on the provenance of looted art, restitution is not simply a question of 'objects' but a vital part of rewriting the ethical relationship between Europe and Africa, not just concerning the past but how they relate in the future.
'Europe owes us the truth about what happened,' says Achille Mbembe, the Cameroonian philosopher. 'But you know, when you look at the history of our engagement with Europe, the one thing a lot of our thinkers and historians have found is that Europe has a serious problem with the truth.'
It is important that no one assumes that some 'things' can be returned and the book be simply closed on a chapter of difficult history. Instead, to return the artefacts is just the beginning of a process of restoration. To keep and learn from that which is returned - through academic research or even children's education programmes - all requires substantial resources as well.
The imminent return of the Benin bronzes is a moment of celebration, yes. But it is also the first step on a long road of awkwardness, tumultuous emotions and complex accountability. We will need to remain committed to the process.",,2021-06-07,molemo moiloa african voice need heard debate restitution loot artefact year benin bronze many house british museum european collection

- British forces seized sculptures and plaques from west Africa in the 19th century
- BLM protests have sparked recent calls for the treasures to be repatriated
- But Lambeth Palace says its two were made recently, with no links to imperialism
Two 'Benin Bronze' sculptures gifted to the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1982 that are set to be repatriated to Nigeria were made in the 1980s, officials have said.
Sculptures and plaques made for royalty in the former Kingdom of Benin and seized by British forces in 1897 have been the subject of growing calls for repatriation to Nigeria after Black Lives Matter protests.
The Benin Bronzes, among the most famous treasures taken, are currently on display at the British Museum, but a number of galleries have recently agreed to send similar items back, with the University of Aberdeen saying last month it would return a sculpture to Nigeria within weeks.
Lambeth Palace, the London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, then pledged to return two statues to given to former Archbishop Robert Runcie and the Church of England by the University of Nigeria in a visit nearly 40 years ago.
However, the two sculptures that are set to be returned as a 'gesture of goodwill' were in fact made in the 1980s, 100 years after most Benin Bronzes were seized, and have no links to Britain's colonial past.
Experts are now questioning why the sculptures are being returned at all, with critics accusing the Church of England of 'penitent decolonialisation' despite the items being unrelated to imperialism.
A spokesman for the palace told the Telegraph: 'The sculptures that we received as gifts in the 1980s are likely to be contemporary from that time.'
Two 'Benin Bronze' sculptures gifted to the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1982 that are set to be repatriated to Nigeria were made in the 1980s, officials have said
Prof Nigel Biggar, professor of theology at the University of Oxford, said: 'Quite what would be intended by such a returning of gifts is not clear.
'Given the present context, it would appear to be an act of penitent 'decolonisation'.
'The items were not seized during the colonial period, indeed, they were not seized at all.
'They were made in the 1980s and have nothing to do with the controversial 'Benin Bronzes'.'
How British forces looted treasures known as the Benin Bronzes
In 1897, a British naval expedition was raised to avenge the deaths of nine officers killed during a trade dispute between the king of Benin and Britain.
Britain sent a force of 500 men to destroy what was then the Kingdom of Benin, which is in modern-day Nigeria.
After ten days of fierce fighting, the British burnt down the palace and looted the royal treasures: delicate ivory carvings and magnificent copper alloy sculptures and plaques - now known as the Benin Bronzes.
After the sacking of Benin, the bronzes were taken by the British to pay for the expedition.
One of them, a bronze cockerel, ended up being a permanent fixture in the dining hall at Jesus College, Cambridge.
Many people have campaigned for the cockerel to be returned over the years and in November last year, Cambridge University agreed to return it to Nigeria.
A number of other museums and universities have since also agreed to send items back in recent weeks.
One campaigner was BBC historian David Olusoga who said The British Museum, which holds hundreds of the sculptures, should have a 'Supermarket Sweep' where countries have two minutes to take back their artefacts.
Lambeth Palace said that after being contacted by campaigners calling for the Benin Bronzes to be repatriated, it was decided to hand over the statues as a 'gesture of goodwill'.
It said in a statement: 'We have recently been contacted by the Digital Benin project at the MARKK (Hamburg) who enquired about our collection of gifts at Lambeth Palace and if we had received any Benin kingdom objects as gifts over the years.
'In response, we have confirmed to the Digital Benin project that we have two bronze busts, given to us by the Benin kingdom in 1982. These were gifted to Archbishop Robert Runcie by His Excellency Chief (Prof.) Ambrose F. Alli and the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.
'We have offered for the two busts to be included in the Digital Benin project and eventually, returned to our friends in Edo, Nigeria where they may remain. We are currently in discussions with the EMOWAA, via the Legacy Restoration Trust, to arrange this.'

Last month, the University of Aberdeen said a sculpture of an Oba, or ruler, of the Kingdom of Benin, had left Nigeria in an 'extremely immoral' fashion, leading it to reach out to authorities in 2019 to negotiate its return.
Neil Curtis, Aberdeen's head of museums and special collections, said the Bronze, purchased in 1957, had been 'blatantly looted.'
'It became clear we had to do something,' Mr Curtis said.
Professor Abba Isa Tijani, director general of Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments, said the importance of displaying the Bronze inside Nigeria for the first time in more than 120 years was inexpressible.
'It's part of our identity, part of our heritage... which has been taken away from us for many years,' Prof Tijani said.
Plaques that form part of the Benin Bronzes are displayed at The British Museum in 2018

The British Museum has, alongside several other museums, formed a Benin Dialogue Group to discuss displaying them in Benin City, some officially on loan. It has said discussions are ongoing.
Germany is in talks to send back 440 Benin Bronzes as early as the autumn, according to newspaper reports, while the University of Cambridge's Jesus College said it had finalised approvals in December to return another Bronze. Prof Tijani said U.S. museums had also agreed to return two more Bronzes.
The governor of Edo state, of which Benin City is the capital, plans to build a centre to store and study the returned artefacts by the end of 2021, and a permanent museum by 2025.
Artist and Edo state native Victor Ehikhamenor said he hoped the decision would prompt others to follow suit.
'Because some of these things are missing from our environment, people are not able to contextualize where we are coming from,' Mr Ehikhamenor said.
The British Museum's most controversial artefacts
The Parthenon Marbles: The Parthenon Marbles - popularly named the Elgin Marbles after the7th Earl of Elgin, the man who took them from Greece - are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants.
The Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.
In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon.
As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site.
His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000.
The sculptures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism.
They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.
Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail.
The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal.
However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable.

Rosetta Stone: One of the most famous objects in the British Museum, the Rosetta Stone is a broken part of a bigger stone slab.
Dating from 196 BC, there is a decree written on it which was issued in Memphis, Egypt, by the King Ptolemy V Epiphanes during the Ptolemaic dynasty. The decree is written three times, in hieroglyphics, Demotic and Ancient Greek.
It is thought to have been found by accident in Egypt in 1799 by Napoleon's army while digging the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta.
When Napoleon was defeated, the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801 meant the stone became British property, along with other things the French had found. It was shipped to England, arriving in Portsmouth in February 1802.

Hoa Hakananai'a: The four-ton, 7ft 10in Easter Island statue is regarded as one of the most spiritually important of the Chilean island's 900 famous stone monoliths, or moai.
Each of the figures is said to embody tribal leaders or deified ancestors.
It was taken from the island, which lies in the Pacific more than 2,100 miles off the coast of Chile, in 1868 by Commodore Richard Powell, captain of HMS Topaze, who gave it to Queen Victoria.
She donated it in 1869 to the British Museum, where it now stands at the entrance to Wellcome Trust Gallery.
But Easter Island's indigenous community, the Rapa Nui, want Britain to give back the spiritually 'unique' effigy.
Governor Tarita Alarcon Rapu found the sight of the artefact so emotional that she burst into tears as she begged the museum to return it.

144,Germany Vows To Return Benin Artifacts – Control TV,https://controltv.ng/germany-vows-to-return-benin-artifacts/,"German government has promised to finally return the precious artifacts that were looted during the colonial era to Nigeria.
Germany’s Ministry of Culture, state ministers, and museum directors in a joint declaration published on Thursday announced the first returns are planned for 2022.

The joint declaration stated that the government is committed to “substantive returns” of Benin artworks.
The artworks, made of bronze, brass, and ivory were taken by the British army in a raid on the Kingdom of Benin, in present-day Nigeria, in 1897.
They were subsequently distributed across the world and hundreds are currently held in German museums.
German Culture Minister, Monika Grütters in a statement described the declaration as a “historic milestone.”

Grütters said, “We face a historic and moral responsibility to shine a light on Germany’s colonial past.
“We would like to contribute to an understanding and reconciliation with the descendants of the people who were robbed of their cultural treasures during the colonial era.”
A historian and researcher at Nigeria’s Institute for Benin Studies, Osaisonor Ekhator-Obogie, who welcomed the declaration, said, Germany is “leading in the global restitution movement.”
Ekhator-Obogie added, “other European nations should be willing and open to acknowledge that all objects looted in 1897 belong to the Benin people.”
“Like Germany, they too should initiate or join the dialogue to discuss the future of these objects.”
“This decision was a truce with parties, not a win-win or winner takes it all. I will tell my children about this historic moment.”
Nigeria has sought the return of artifacts for decades.

147,The Best Movies From the 2016 Cannes Film Festival,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/best-cannes-movies-2016/,"Despite a heavy police presence amid fears of terrorism, the 2016 Cannes Film Festival got underway on May 11, with an auteur-stocked lineup emblematic of the world’s most prestigious film festival. And, with the glorious cinephile wonderland returning for its 69th edition, it can only mean one thing: It’s time for us to round up the films shown around the Promenade de la Croisette.
With the latest films by heavyweights Shane Black and Steven Spielberg, plus new work from some of the globe’s most celebrated filmmakers, including Britain’s Ken Loach and Spain’s Pedro Almodóvar, the 2016 gathering of cinema’s best and brightest contains multitudes: the Oscars stuff, the commercial stuff and the artsy stuff.
So, without further ado, here are Hignsnobiety’s very own top 20 films coming out of Cannes this year.
Neruda
Director: Pablo Larraín
Four years ago, Larraín scored a critical hit in the Directors’ Fortnight program with No, his political dramedy set during the final days of Pinochet’s reign of terror. The Chilean director is back in the Fortnight this year with a flick starring Luis Gnecco as the famous poet and politician during his years in exile and hiding, and subsequent pursuit by an investigator (played by Gael Garcia Bernal in a wonderfully comic performance).
Larraín, whose tonally varied work is always predicated on a precise marriage of style and subject matter, is the perfect director for this love letter to the poems of Pablo Neruda and to breathe fresh life into the great-artist biopic template.
The BFG
Director: Steven Spielberg
There’s one reason Spielberg and Roald Dahl’s classic children’s book are such a neat fit: the director and his lead character are basically kindred spirits. The Big Friendly Giant (played by Mark Rylance), bottles dreams and puffs them into children’s heads at night: Spielberg, meanwhile, was inspired to make Close Encounters of the Third Kind by memories of watching a meteor shower with his father, and based E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial on an imaginary friend he created to cope with his parents’ divorce.
With his BFG, he immerses us in a beautifully realized fantasy world, while providing us with all the feels with the film’s central relationship.
The Last Face
Director: Sean Penn
It’s been almost 10 years since Penn’s last directorial feature, Into the Wild. Now he’s back with his distinctive Charlize Theron, Javier Bardem and Adèle Exarchopoulos-starring drama.
Theron plays the director of an international aid agency in Africa, who meets a relief aid doctor (Bardem) during a political/social revolution. In the situation, they are presented with difficult choices when it comes to humanitarianism amidst civil unrest.
Clash
Director: Mohamed Diab
To explain the chaos that erupted after the Egyptian revolution, Diab has crafted an ingenious construct. Set in 2013, two years after the Tahrir Square protests (already covered excellently in Jehane Noujaim’s documentary The Square), his naturalistic drama is spent entirely in a police riot van in the midst of violent protests.
There’s a lesson or two about humanity to take away from Clash… You’ll end up being deeply disturbed but also perfectly illuminated by Diab’s work.
Paterson
Director: Jim Jarmusch
The king of indie movie cool is back with Paterson, offering what might be the most attractive pairing of the festival: Adam Driver and the Iranian star Golshifteh Farahani. Driver is the bus driver who writes poetry and comes home to his loving wife (Farahani) who has dreams of her own.
Of his generation of US independent filmmakers, Jarmusch has stayed the course and stayed weird, while others fell by the wayside (Hal Hartley) or learned to work with the mainstream (Spike Lee, the Coens). Jarmusch is a Cannes mainstay and without a doubt the most rock'n'roll of filmmakers – our money’s on the fact that his latest entry will mystify quite a few diehard admirers.
Aquarius
Director: Kleber Mendonca Filhi
Brazilian director Filho’s Neighbouring Sounds was a hugely admired arthouse-circuit movie and his fascinatingly weird follow-up Aquarius gets a competition slot.
The movie follows 65-year-old Clara (Sonia Braga), a retired music writer and critic, widowed and alone in the apartment building Aquarius after her three grown children have moved away. Clara is pressured into selling her apartment by developers – a theme that seems to speak of the bigger picture of Brazil’s municipal corruption and malfeasance – oh, and she’s mastered the gift of time travel…
Risk
Director: Laura Poitras
Although he is still confined in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Julian Assange will make an appearance at the Cannes Film Festival – via Laura Poitras’s documentary, which has been selected for the Directors’ Fortnight sidebar.
Poitras, who profiled another celebrated data warrior, Edward Snowden, in Citizenfour, filmed with Assange in 2010. Her film – originally entitled Asylum – is said to cover the period when the WikiLeaks data dumps were triggering international outrage.
Sweet Dreams (Fai bei sogni)
Director: Marco Bellocchio
Sweet Dreams is based on journalist Massimo Gramellini’s best-selling autobiographical novel about a boy’s grief over his mother’s death.
Bellocchio is an interesting visual director and begins the film with the memories of young Massimo, until his mother’s early and suspicious death sends him through the decades as an emotionally impaired man, fully embracing the melodrama of the source material.
Slack Bay (Ma Loute)
Director: Bruno Dumont
Slack Bay features a gallery of outrageous performances from French cinema A-listers including Juliette Binoche. Of course, all of them go wayyy over the top; even when Dumont is doing “funny,” you need to be prepared for a bunch of people to be killed, chopped up into tiny pieces, and fed to kids.
This time around, it’s summer 1910 and several tourists have vanished while relaxing on the beautiful beaches of the Channel Coast. Slack Bay ruminates on class, murder and French history – and does it all in the most bizarre way possible.
I, Daniel Blake
Director: Ken Loach
Loach‘s new film, that takes an uncompromising look at the UK’s welfare system, reduced critics at Cannes to tears.
The brutally moving drama, set in Newcastle (and shown at the event with subtitles in case people couldn’t understand the Geordie accent), tells the fictional story of carpenter Daniel Blake who suffers a heart attack and is told by doctors he can no longer work. Loach commented that “the most vulnerable people are told their poverty is their own fault… It is shocking.”
The Nice Guys
Director: Shane Black
Shane Black is an old-school kind of guy – he’s littered movie theaters with sordid tales of L.A. for 30 years now, from 1987’s Lethal Weapon to 2013’s Iron Man 3 and his latest, The Nice Guys, doesn’t mess with that formula.
Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling star (and totally nail it!) as a pair of sound-hearted guys off on the trail of a missing porn star in the crime caper. It feels like a movie you should already be referencing as an example of the type of movie that studios don't make anymore, but you can't because it's new.
It’s Only the End of the World (Juste la Fin Du Monde)
Director: Xavier Dolan
Canadian director Dolan, a positive veteran of Cannes with a clutch of features under his belt, is still – sickeningly – only 27-years-old.
His Mommy was a smash hit at Cannes in 2014 and now he is in competition once more with It’s Only the End of the World, with Lea Seydoux and Marion Cotillard. The flick – which follows a terminally ill writer who returns home after a long absence to tell his family that he’s dying – might be seen as a further, important test of Dolan’s sinew as a director, had he not already produced so much substantial work.
American Honey
Director: Andrea Arnold
Shia LaBeouf has never looked worse or acted better than in Arnold’s scuzzy road movie following a crew of exploited teenagers who get an itinerant job in the Midwest, selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door.
The flick is continuously fascinating, expertly showing us youth in revolt and pleasure-seeking as a design for life. LaBeouf, sporting a ratty braided ponytail and covered in tattoos, gives a striking performance. And the film also features what is probably the hippest soundtrack of Cannes.
The Handmaiden (Ah-ga-ssi)
Director: Chan-wook Park
The acclaimed Korean filmmaker’s latest is a 1930s-set erotic thriller that prioritizes female sexuality and also stylized to within an inch of its life. It’s dripping in arty excess and still demands that you pay attention to its clever plot.
Premiering at Cannes exactly a year after the handsome yet overrated lesbian romance Carol, Park has provided us with something a bit more debauched; unlike Haynes’s chemistry-free drama, The Handmaiden is full of sex. As usual, Oldboy director Park has taken the material to extremes – what begins as a refined story of intrigue veers into unmistakeable NC-17 territory.
Tour de France
Director: Rachid Djaidani
If the prospect of watching an ageing Gerard Depardieu rap sounds to you like reason enough to see a movie, then this flick definitely delivers.
Tour de France follows a racist man forced to travel across France with a young rapper; Djaidani is using the film to serve as a gentle nudge for France's more conservative population. It’s fresh cinematography and Gallic rap soundtrack keeps things upbeat throughout.
My Life As a Zucchini (Ma vie de courgette)
Director: Claude Barras
Barras’s quirky stop motion animation follows a nine-year-old boy nicknamed ""Zucchini"" by his alcoholic mother, who is orphaned following her sudden death and joins a foster home full of other children who have experienced abuse or neglect.
This is not the stuff of which kids’ movies are typically made, and while the flick falls into that zone of animation that’s mature enough for adults to appreciate, it deals frankly with the facts of life in a way that doesn’t scare younger audiences.
Julieta
Director: Pedro Almodóvar
Almodóvar fit right in at this year’s Cannes, which was full of films that went over the top in dealing with unconventional topics and lots of sex... After all, the Spanish director has been doing that kind of thing for decades.
Based on three Alice Munro short stories, his Julieta follows our titular mother who has just lost her husband in Madrid. Her 18-year-old daughter also just ran away without any explanation. As Julieta attempts to find her, she realizes that she knows very little about her own child.
Kitty
Director: Chloë Sevigny
Chloë Sevigny has a self-proclaimed disdain for directors now. To counter that, she’s stepping behind the camera and taking matters into her own hands.
Her directorial debut at Cannes is based on a Paul Bowles short story about a little girl who dreams of becoming a kitten and finds herself transformed into one. “I wanted to do kind of a throwback to those ‘80s films where they had an element of practical effects and makeup and stuff, and I could incorporate all that,” Sevigny commented.
Loving
Director: Jeff Nichols
Jeff Nichols is fast becoming the American filmmaker to whom Cannes gives its blessing; his previous flicks Take Shelter and Mud both featured there and this year he returned with his new feature, Loving.
Based on a 2012 HBO documentary by Nancy Buirski called The Loving Story, the film is about a notorious 1958 legal case in the US, in which an interracial couple Richard and Mildred Loving were imprisoned for getting married.
The Neon Demon
Director: Nicholas Winding Refn
Drive and Bronson director Refn brought The Neon Demon to Cannes this year, starring Jena Malone as an aspiring model who comes to L.A. and finds herself under attack from sinister forces. It’s a characteristically stylish film containing vampirism and cannibalism.
Speaking about his inspiration for the flick, Refn commented that, “one morning I woke and realized I was both surrounded and dominated by women. Strangely, a sudden urge was planted in me to make a horror film about vicious beauty.” Fine by us!",,2016-05-20,despite heavy police presence amid fear terrorism 2016 cannes film festival get

148,The violence of colonialism makes its way into the collective ...,https://marketresearchtelecast.com/the-violence-of-colonialism-makes-its-way-into-the-collective-memory-of-europe/70108/,"It took the French state 50 years to recognize that it was its police forces, and not the Nazis, who carried out the mass deportations of Jews in France. Jacques Chirac broke that taboo in 1995. “There are moments in the life of a nation,” exclaimed the then conservative French president, “that hurt the memory and the idea that a country makes of itself.” However, it took another 16 years for France to recognize a crime that it had committed long before: it was not until the 21st century when, thanks to the Taubira Law, the State, through Parliament, apologized for slavery, abolished in 1848.
The norm is named after the deputy of Guyana Christiane Taubira, who in 1999 presented a bill for the National Assembly to recognize as a crime against humanity “the transatlantic slave trade and slavery, perpetrated from the 15th century by the European powers against the African populations deported to Europe, America and the Indian Ocean ”. It was approved in 2001, a century and a half after abolition.
While the debate over responsibility for the horrors of World War II underwent a major shift in the late 1960s – German Chancellor Willy Brandt became knelt before the monument to the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto on December 7, 1970 in a gesture that symbolizes that process – the open discussion on the crimes of colonization has taken longer to arrive, driven, among other things, by the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, but also by the need to establish a new relationship with the former colonies.
Germany has just recognized as genocide the mass murder, between 1904 and 1908, of the Hereros and Nama in present-day Namibia and has promised reparations of 1.1 billion euros, which have been received with considerable skepticism in this country on the west coast. African. Around the same time, French President Emmanuel Macron recognized the sinister role his country played in the 1994 Rwandan genocide under Socialist President François Mitterrand. He spoke of “overwhelming responsibility” in a crime against humanity, whose executors received the silence, if not the support, of the French State that was moved by old colonial reflections.
“This is a major movement, a change of course,” explains José Luis Villacañas, professor of Philosophy at the Complutense University of Madrid, who has studied the colonial empire of Spain, a country that lost its main overseas territories long before than the rest of the European powers. “European colonialism has been the subject of deep intellectual criticism by Eurocentrism and imperialism. Under these conditions, not exceeding that stage in which Europe was the center of the world results in a foreign policy that is not very operational in areas where China has entered, which presents itself as a non-imperialist country. If Europe wants to win softpower it has to get rid of that colonial past, against which the current African leaders have fought ”.
Celeste Muñoz Martínez, professor of African history at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, who is part of the European Observatory of Memories, in which he deals with the area of slavery and colonialism, relates this turn in many countries to the upheaval represented by the Black Lives Matter movement, unleashed in the United States by police violence against blacks, because it made visible the racism that still exists today. it exists in many western societies as an undigested remnant of the ideologies that sparked colonialism and slavery.
“Black Lives Matter has prompted a reflection on the origin of this racism,” says Muñoz Martínez. “The main reaction was to attack monuments of colonialism, appealing to the place that colonial and slave memory occupies in public space”; This researcher continues, pointing out, for example, the removal of the statue of the Marqués de Comillas in Barcelona. In other cases, such as the statues of King Leopold in Belgium, they were vandalized. “In Europe the most important issues are now compensation, although what they will be like has not yet been completed. We do not know to whom they will be distributed, or with what criteria. Another issue is the return of the looted patrimony ”, continues this researcher.
Slavery and colonialism are two connected and, at the same time, different processes. In America they are closely related because between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries this territory received millions of human beings uprooted from Africa to work until death on its plantations. However, the colonialism of the 19th and 20th centuries took place when slavery was already abolished, although it was driven by racist thinking (as can be clearly seen in Hergé’s first album, Tintin in the Congo). “It is based on ideologies of dehumanization and civilization”, explains Muñoz Martínez, “which argued that it was carried out for the benefit of the populations that were colonized. It is a speech that allowed establishing racial hierarchies ”.
Belgium, with the recognition of the crimes of King Leopold in Congo, which inspired the great novel by Joseph Conrad Heart of Darkness, was the pioneer, with a change of attitude towards the past, symbolized in the radical transformation that the Royal African Museum underwent turned into AfrikaMuseum: from a purely colonial museum it became an exhibition on colonialism. Book, The ghost of King Leopold, Adam Hochschild’s, which was rejected by 10 publishers before becoming an international hit in the early 2000s, helped spark this change. The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States are immersed in similar processes of reflection on the past. Plaques begin to appear in ports where the slave trade took place, such as in La Rochelle (France), the narrative of museums changes or new ones are inaugurated and a debate has been opened on the restitution of objects resulting from colonial looting (Germany has pledged to return the so-called Bronzes of Benin, while a report commissioned by Macron ruled in favor of returning African art).
However, there is still a long way to go, as is clear from the rise of far-right parties that display clearly racist discourses without complex. Professor Muñoz Martínez recalls the scandal that occurred in England when it was learned that in 2015 they finally finished paying compensation to slave owners for the abolition of 1835, while reparations have never been contemplated for the descendants of slaves (who had contributed with their taxes to pay those reparations to the families of those who were able to enslave their ancestors).
Many descendants of those who suffered from colonialism (and who in many cases still suffer from racism) believe that this process has only just begun. Haitian-born French-based filmmaker Raoul Peck, who just premiered the series on HBO Exterminate all the savages on the horrors of colonialism, he recently pointed out in an interview with this newspaper: “Europe is still in denial. I would not put all European countries in the same bag, but it is clear that when we watch television, when we read the newspapers, I have the clear impression that a large part of Europe is in denial. When we allow ourselves to criticize a part of this past, it is always done with certain nuances, we recognize that yes, it is true, that we did it, but we are forced to explain it. And we think that this does not give the right to do this or to burn down the ghettos. So there is no real deep analysis of colonization. “",,2021-06-11,take french state 50 year recognize police force nazi carry mass deportation jew france jacques chirac broke taboo 1995 there moment

152,Mary Beard On Roman Emperor Nero The Week In Art podcast,https://player.fm/series/the-week-in-art/mary-beard-on-roman-emperor-nero,"Mary Beard on Roman emperor Nero
This week: Mary Beard on Nero, one of the most infamous Roman emperors. Was he the sadistic murderer of legend, the emperor who fiddled as Rome burned, or has he been a victim of spin and myth? As well as getting Mary’s take on this infamous figure and Nero: the man behind the myth, the exhibition about him that’s just opened at the British Museum in London, Ben Luke also talks to the exhibition's curator Thorsten Opper.
Also this week, as the first London Gallery Weekend begins—with 140 galleries from Mayfair to Mile End taking part—The Art Newspaper's editor-at-large Georgina Adam speaks to Jeremy Epstein, co-founder of Edel Assanti gallery and one of the founders of London Gallery Weekend initiative. And in this episode’s Work of the Week, we talk to the artist Nina Katchadourian about a very personal piece of embroidery, created by her adopted grandmother, which has inspired a new work by the artist in her show at Pace in New York.

154,Hong Kong activist Agnes Chow released on protest ...,https://latestnews.in.net/hong-kong-activist-agnes-chow-released-on-protest-anniversary-hong-kong-protests-news/,"Hong Kong activist Agnes Chow released on protest anniversary | Hong Kong Protests News
The 24-year-old activist served nearly seven months for her role in an unauthorised assembly during anti-government protests in the city in 2019.
Hong Kong democracy activist Agnes Chow was released Saturday from prison on the second anniversary of the city’s huge democracy rallies, with police out in force and protests now all but banned.
Two thousand officers have been placed on standby after social media calls for residents to commemorate the failed democracy demonstrations.
Authorities have maintained a coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings despite the city recording just three local infections in the last month.
A Beijing-imposed national security law has also criminalised much dissent and most of the city’s democracy leaders have been arrested, jailed or fled overseas.
On Saturday morning, one of those figures walked free from prison.
Chow, 24, was mobbed by waiting media but made no comment as she was driven away.
Supporters shouted “Agnes Chow add oil”, a Cantonese-language expression of encouragement that was widely used at the protests that roiled the city.
Some supporters wore black T-shirts and yellow masks and one held a yellow umbrella, a symbol of protests in the former British colony dating back to 2014.
Sweeping crackdown
Chow hails from a generation of activists who cut their teeth in politics as teenagers and became an inspiration for those who chafe under Beijing’s increasingly authoritarian rule.
She spent some seven months behind bars for her role in a 2019 protest outside the city’s police headquarters. Fellow youth activists Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam were sentenced in the same case.
Chow’s release comes at a sensitive time.
Two years ago on June 12, thousands of protesters surrounded the city’s legislature in an attempt to stop the passage of a bill that could have allowed extraditions to mainland China’s judicial system.
Riot police used tear gas and rubber-coated bullets to disperse the huge crowds.
Footage of the clashes deepened public anger, and fuelled what became an increasingly violent movement calling for full democracy that raged for seven straight months.
Huge crowds rallied week after week in the most serious challenge to China’s rule since Hong Kong’s 1997 handover.
Beijing’s leaders have dismissed the call for democracy, portraying those who protested as stooges of “foreign forces” trying to undermine China.
They have since overseen a sweeping crackdown that has successfully curbed dissent and radically transformed the once outspoken semi-autonomous city.
The spear tip of that crackdown has been the national security law.
More than 100 people have been arrested under the new law, including Chow, although she has not yet been charged.
Dozens more have been charged, including jailed pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai.
Most have been denied bail and they face up to life in jail if convicted.
Protests have been extremely restricted for the last year in Hong Kong, but anniversary events have tended to focus attention.
On Friday, two activists from Student Politicism, a pro-democracy group, were arrested on suspicion of advertising an unauthorised assembly.
Last week, authorities banned an annual candlelight vigil to commemorate victims of Beijing’s deadly 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
However, many in Hong Kong still quietly signalled defiance by turning on mobile phone lights and lighting candles that evening.",,2021-06-12,hong kong activist agnes chow release protest anniversary hong kong protest news 24 year old activist serve nearly seven month role unauthorised assembly anti government protest city 2019 hong kong democracy activist agnes chow release saturday prison second anniversary city huge democracy rally police force protest ban two thousand officer place standby social medium call resident commemorate fail democracy demonstration authority maintain coronavirus prohibition public gathering despite city record three local infection last month beijing impose national security law also criminalise much dissent city democracy leader arrest jail flee overseas saturday morning one figure walk free prison chow 24 mobbed wait medium make comment driven away supporter shout agnes chow add oil cantonese language expression encouragement widely use protest roil city supporter wore black t shirt yellow mask one held yellow umbrella symbol protest former british colony date back 2014 sweep crackdown chow hail generation activist cut teeth politics teenager become inspiration chafe beijing increasingly authoritarian rule spent seven month behind bar role 2019 protest outside city police headquarters fellow youth activist joshua wong ivan lam sentence case chow release come sensitive time two year ago june 12 thousand protester surround city legislature attempt stop passage bill could allow extradition mainland china judicial system riot police use tear gas rubber coat bullet disperse huge crowd footage clash deepen public anger fuel become increasingly violent movement call full democracy rag seven straight month huge crowd rally week week serious challenge china rule since hong kongs 1997 handover beijing leader dismiss call democracy portray protest stooge foreign force try undermine china since overseen sweep crackdown successfully curbed dissent radically transform outspoken semi autonomous city spear tip crackdown national security law 100 people arrest new law include chow although yet charge dozen charge include jail pro democracy medium tycoon jimmy lai deny bail face life jail convict protest extremely restrict last year hong kong anniversary event tend focus attention friday two activist student politicism pro democracy group arrest suspicion advertising unauthorised assembly last week authority ban annual candlelight vigil commemorate victim beijing deadly 1989 tiananmen square crackdown however many hong kong still quietly signal defiance turn mobile phone light light candle even,hong kong activist agn chow releas protest anniversari hong kong protest news 24 year old activist serv nearli seven month role unauthoris assembl anti govern protest citi 2019 hong kong democraci activist agn chow releas saturday prison second anniversari citi huge democraci ralli polic forc protest ban two thousand offic place standbi social media call resid commemor fail democraci demonstr author maintain coronaviru prohibit public gather despit citi record three local infect last month beij impos nation secur law also criminalis much dissent citi democraci leader arrest jail fled oversea saturday morn one figur walk free prison chow 24 mob wait media made comment driven away support shout agn chow add oil cantones languag express encourag wide use protest roil citi support wore black t shirt yellow mask one held yellow umbrella symbol protest former british coloni date back 2014 sweep crackdown chow hail gener activist cut teeth polit teenag becam inspir chafe beij increasingli authoritarian rule spent seven month behind bar role 2019 protest outsid citi polic headquart fellow youth activist joshua wong ivan lam sentenc case chow releas come sensit time two year ago june 12 thousand protest surround citi legislatur attempt stop passag bill could allow extradit mainland china judici system riot polic use tear ga rubber coat bullet dispers huge crowd footag clash deepen public anger fuell becam increasingli violent movement call full democraci rage seven straight month huge crowd ralli week week seriou challeng china rule sinc hong kong 1997 handov beij leader dismiss call democraci portray protest stoog foreign forc tri undermin china sinc overseen sweep crackdown success curb dissent radic transform outspoken semi autonom citi spear tip crackdown nation secur law 100 peopl arrest new law includ chow although yet charg dozen charg includ jail pro democraci media tycoon jimmi lai deni bail face life jail convict protest extrem restrict last year hong kong anniversari event tend focu attent friday two activist student politic pro democraci group arrest suspicion advertis unauthoris assembl last week author ban annual candlelight vigil commemor victim beij deadli 1989 tiananmen squar crackdown howev mani hong kong still quietli signal defianc turn mobil phone light light candl even
155,The Benin Bronzes: A Tragic Story of Slavery and Imperialism ...,https://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/benin-bronzes-008565,"The Benin Bronzes: A Tragic Story of Slavery and Imperialism Cast in Brass
The Benin Bronzes is the name given to a group of artifacts produced by the Benin Empire, which occupied the area which is today Nigeria. The Benin Bronzes consist of several thousand commemorative plaques and sculptures that are made of brass of variable composition (despite being called ‘bronzes’).
While such metalwork was already being produced by the craftsmen of the Benin Empire as early as the 13th century, many of the Benin Bronzes were created between the 15th and 16th centuries. The Benin Bronzes were seized by British forces during the Benin Expedition of 1897, and were given to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Many of the pieces were later sold, and ended up in the collections of museums around the world. Today, there are calls for the bronzes to be repatriated to their country of origin.

Skillful Creations
Brass plaques and sculptures were being created by the Edo (known also as the Bini), the indigenous people of the Benin Empire, as early as the 13th century, prior to their contact with Europeans. These pieces of metalwork were produced using a process known as lost-wax casting, a technique that was discovered as early as the Copper Age. The Benin Bronzes are some of the best examples of sculptures produced by this technique.

- The Origins of Voodoo, the Misunderstood Religion
- Oshun, African Goddess of Love and Sweet Waters
The Benin Bronzes depict a variety of different themes. On the plaques, for instance, human figures, either alone, in pairs, or in small groups arranged hierarchically around a central figure, are represented. As for the sculptures, common themes include animals, human beings and scenes from life in the royal court of Benin. Interestingly, following their contact with the West, Europeans also began to be portrayed by the Edo craftsmen in their artworks. Portuguese soldiers / mercenaries, for instance, are often depicted, and may be recognized by the firearms they carry.

A high level of skill was required for the production of the Benin Bronzes. The craftsmen who made the Benin Bronzes paid great attention to the details of their creations. This is evident, for instance, in the minute details found on the attire worn by the human figures.
Further proof of the craftsmen’s mastery of their art can be seen in the fact that the surfaces of the pieces were designed to show contrasts when the metal was irradiated by a source of light. While the human figures represented are more naturalistic than most African art of that period, the facial features of most figures are exaggerated from their natural proportions.

The Human Cost of the Bronzes
The metal required for the production of the Benin Bronzes was acquired in a form known as manilla. This was a form of money in the shape of bracelets that were usually made either of bronze or of copper. These were brought to the Benin Empire by European traders, and were usually exchanged for slaves. Therefore, it may be said that the history of the Benin Bronzes is closely connected to the slave trade, and that these beautiful pieces of art were made possible by the heinous trade in human lives.

Nevertheless, this side of the story is often overshadowed by another episode in the history of the Benin Bronzes. In 1897, a punitive expedition known as the Benin Campaign of 1897 was launched by the British against Benin City. The Benin Empire was defeated, Benin City was burned and looted, and the Benin Bronzes were seized by the victorious British troops as war booty.
These pieces of art were sent to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, many of which were then sold to cover the cost of the expedition. A large number of the Benin Bronzes ended up in the British Museum, while other pieces were purchased by museums around the world.

Fair Spoils or Time for Repatriation?
There have been many calls over the years for the Benin Bronzes to be repatriated to their country of origin. Occasionally, these have met with success. In 2014, for example, two pieces of the Benin Bronzes were returned to Nigeria by Mark Walker, the grandson of one of the soldiers who took part in the campaign of 1897.
In 2016, a bronze cockerel was taken down from the hall of Jesus College, Cambridge University, and discussions have been underway about repatriating the artifact ever since. As of 2019, no date had been provided for the bronze cockerel’s possible return to Nigeria, but the college stated that it “belongs with the current Oba at the Court of Benin.”
For the time being, many museums, such as the British Museum where many of the Benin Bronzes are kept today, are still resisting the calls to repatriate these artifacts.
Germany Promises to Hand Back Benin Bronzes
However, The Guardian reports that Germany will be the first country to hand back at least some of their Benin bronzes. The country’s culture minister, Monika Grütters, recently announced that Germany will start returning a “substantial” collection of the artifacts to Nigeria in 2022. Grütters said, “We face up to our historic and moral responsibility to shine a light and work on Germany’s historic past. The treatment of the Benin bronzes is a touchstone [of this process].”
The unknown number of Benin Bronzes will be returned to “a politically neutral body, the newly founded Legacy Restoration Trust,” according to The Guardian. Germany says they will also help fund the creation of a pavilion to hold the artifacts until they can be added to the collection of the Edo Museum of West African Art, which is set to be completed in 2025.

156,African History -The Stolen Benin Bronzes | Transition Studies,https://environmentaljusticetv.wordpress.com/2020/09/03/african-history-the-stolen-benin-bronzes/,"The Benin Expedition of 1897 was a punitive expedition by a United Kingdom force of 1,200 under Admiral Sir Harry Rawson. Rawson’s troops captured, burned, and looted Benin City. As a result much of the country’s art, including the Benin Bronzes, was either destroyed, looted or dispersed.
In this video the scale and shock of this deplorable act is brought home in the form of clay reproductions of the stolen bronzes –
Immediately after the British invaders secured the city, looting began. It was an exercise that was carried out by all members of the expedition. Monuments and palaces of many high-ranking chiefs were looted. Homes, religious buildings and palaces were deliberately torched. On the third day, the blaze grew out of control and engulfed part of the city. Most of the plunder was retained by the expedition with some 2500 (official figures) religious artefacts, Benin visual history, mnemonics and artworks being sent to England.
The British Admiralty confiscated and auctioned off the war booty. The expected revenue from the expedition was discussed already before Phillips set out on his ill-fated journey to the city of Benin in 1896. In a letter to Lord Salisbury, the British Foreign Secretary, Phillips requested approval to invade Benin and depose the Oba, adding the following footnote: “I would add that I have reason to hope that sufficient ivory would be found in the King’s house to pay the expenses incurred in removing the King from his stool.”
In late 1897 the art was auctioned in Paris, France, to raise funds to pay for the expedition.
Most of the Benin bronzes went first to purchasers in Germany, but a sizeable group is now back in London at the British Museum. The dispersement of the Benin art to museums around the world catalysed the beginnings of a long and slow European reassessment of the value of West African art.

157,Germany to return looted Benin bronze artefacts to Nigeria ...,https://myaimreport.com/2021/04/30/germany-to-return-looted-benin-bronze-artefacts-to-nigeria/,"German officials say they have reached an agreement with Nigeria to return some of the famed Benin Bronzes that were looted from Nigeria in the 19th century.
About 500 of the plundered artifacts are on display in several German museums.
The handoff is expected to take place next year under an agreement reached between Germany and Nigeria on Thursday.
The return of the artefacts is “a turning point in our approach to colonial history,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.
In 1897, British soldiers snatched thousands of exquisitely decorated bronze and brass plaques and sculptures created by guilds in the Kingdom of Benin in what is now Nigeria.
The objects have become known as the Benin Bronzes and are on display in museums around the world.

ultural treasures should be displayed in the context in which they originated; only then can they be truly understood. In the case of the Elgin marbles this is an architectural context which only proximity to the Parthenon itself can provide.
No because…
Art treasures should be accessible to the greatest number of people and to scholars, and in practice this means retaining them in the great museums of the world. Returning treasures to their original context is impossible, too much has changed physically and culturally over the centuries for them to speak more clearly in their country of origin than they do in museums, where they can be compared to large assemblies of objects from a wide variety of cultures. In any case, perfect laser-cut copies could be placed on the Parthenon and in other original locations, if it were so desired.
Display of cultural treasures in western museums is a last hangover from the imperial belief that “c…
Yes because…
Display of cultural treasures in western museums is a last hangover from the imperial belief that “civilised” states such as Britain were the true successors to Greece and Rome, and that the modern inhabitants of those ancient regions were unable to appreciate or look after their great artistic heritage. Whether that was true in the 19th century is open to doubt it certainly is not valid today and the display of imperial trophies in institutions such as the British Museum or the Louvre has become offensive.
No because…
For whatever reason the treasures were first collected, we should not rewrite history; sending artefacts such as the Elgin marbles back to their country of origin would set a bad precedent that could denude museums around the world of their collections. Placing great artefacts in a geographical and cultural ghetto, whereby Greek sculptures could only be viewed in Greece, or Egyptian mummies in Egypt, would leave the world much poorer and reduce popular understanding of the achievements of such civilisations.
Artefacts such as the Parthenon marbles were often acquired illegally, for example through looting i…
Yes because…
Artefacts such as the Parthenon marbles were often acquired illegally, for example through looting in war (the Benin bronzes), under the duress of imperial force (many Chinese artefacts), or by bribing officials to ignore the carrying away of sculptures from monuments they were meant to be guarding (the Elgin marbles).
No because…
Although some art treasures may have been acquired illegally, the evidence for this is often ambiguous. Lord Elgin’s bribes were the common way of facilitating any business in the Ottoman Empire, and do not undermine Britain’s solid legal claim to the Parthenon marbles, based upon a written contract made by the international-recognised authorities in Athens at the time. And while some Benin bronzes were undoubtedly looted, other “colonial trophies” were freely sold to the imperial powers, indeed some were made specifically for the European market.
Some cultural treasures, e.g Native American artefacts, have religious and cultural associations for…
Yes because…
Some cultural treasures, e.g Native American artefacts, have religious and cultural associations for the area from which they were taken, but none for those who view them in sterile glass cases. To the descendants of their creators it is offensive to see aspects of their spirituality displayed for entertainment.
No because…
This may be true, but religious artefacts may have been originally purchased or given in good faith, perhaps with the intention of educating a wider public about the beliefs of their creators. Later descendants should not be allowed to second-guess their ancestors’ intentions. On the other hand, a great many cultural treasures relate to religions and cultures which no longer survive and there can be no such claim for their return.
It may have been true that countries such as Greece were not capable of looking after their heritage…
Yes because…
It may have been true that countries such as Greece were not capable of looking after their heritage in the past, but that has now changed. A state-of-the-art museum has now been completed in Athens to house the surviving marbles, while pollution control measures have reduced sulphur-dioxide levels in the city to a fifth of their previous levels. At the same time the curatorship of institutions such as the British Museum is being called into question, as it becomes apparent that controversial cleaning and restoration practices may have harmed the sculptures they claim to protect.
No because…
In the case of the Parthenon marbles, Lord Elgin’s action in removing them was an act of rescue as the Ottoman authorities were pillaging them for building stone, caring nothing for the classical Greek heritage. Furthermore, if they had been returned upon Greek independence in 1830, the heavily polluted air of Athens would by now have destroyed them.

360,"Law, Restitution and the Benin Bronzes | Institute of Art and Law",https://ial.uk.com/law-restitution-and-the-benin-bronzes/,"Law, Restitution and the Benin Bronzes
Posted on: December 23, 2018 by Alexander Herman
In 1897, British troops marched on Benin City, capital of the fabled West African kingdom of Benin, ruled over by a powerful Oba. The attack was called a ‘punitive expedition’ because it was a retaliatory response to the Oba having massacred a British delegation of eight officials, two traders and local escorts the previous month. After the British victory, the troops destroyed the town and took away nearly 2,000 plaques and sculptures, known thereafter as the ‘Benin Bronzes’. These pieces were brought back to Britain: many were transferred by the Foreign Office to the British Museum, while a good number were sold to foreign buyers as far away as Germany and America.
This was the typical practice for a punitive expedition at the time: march on the despised local ruler, raze the town to teach him a lesson and take away items of value that could be sold in order to finance the expedition. It was a very economical affair. But was it right to strip the defeated power of all items of value, especially those with cultural or religious significance?
The international rules regarding the treatment of cultural property are complex. Today, there are a host of international conventions that protect cultural property and heritage in times both of peace and war, not to mention the local laws that each country has implemented internally. But what of times past?
For centuries armed conflict was wrapped up with the pillaging of sacred places and the removal of artefacts of value, such as golden idols, libation bowls, thrones or ancient weaponry. An illustration of the age-old practice can be seen on the Arch of Titus in Rome which depicts the Roman legions looting the temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE and carrying off a large six-pronged menorah.
Things started to change in the early nineteenth century – more precisely, in 1815. This was the year of Napoleon’s defeat, when the victorious Allies had to face a tough question: what was to be done with all the works of art Napoleon had taken from the princely states during his victorious march across the continent? Should the artworks remain at the Louvre, the museum that had become the deposit-house of the French Empire? The answer was an emphatic no.
The most prominent advocates of the policy of restitution were the heads of the British delegation in Paris at the time: the Foreign Secretary Castlereagh and the Duke of Wellington. Castlereagh stated categorically that the artworks taken by the French ‘contrary to every principle of justice, and to the usages of modern warfare’ should be promptly returned; while Wellington personally assisted the King of the Netherlands in reclaiming his royal collection from the Louvre. Not everything was restituted, however. This was because the Louvre’s canny director had spirited a number of pieces off to provincial museums where the Allies couldn’t find them; others were simply too big to carry without causing irreparable damage. On the whole, over half the works taken by the French were recovered, including famous pieces like the Laocoön which went back to the Vatican, the Medici Venus which went back to Florence and a collection of ten Cranachs which went back to Prussia.
1815 represents the beginning of a sea change in the international treatment of cultural objects. Even though the returns were not provided for by treaty or convention, the principle of restitution can be seen from that point forward as a developing custom of international law. International law is a funny thing: legal rules can arise not just out of treaties, but also out of custom, meaning a generalised state practice. Custom is invariably difficult to pin down, for the obvious reason that it can’t be traced to any single legal instrument. But if enough states operate in a certain way (such as in protecting works of art in times of war), then a custom may indeed arise, one that can have legal consequences.
It is generally accepted by legal scholars that a custom that protected cultural objects during war began to develop around 1815. This development continued until it was finally codified at the end of the nineteenth century in an international convention on the rules of warfare, agreed to by 51 countries at the Hague, Netherlands in 1899. The Hague Convention sets out, in particular, a clear rule that both pillage and the seizure of works of art are prohibited, the latter to be made the subject of legal proceedings (see in particular Articles 47 and 56 of the Hague Convention’s Regulations).
Due to the way customs come into being, these principles were likely in place prior to the Hague Convention, although they lacked enforceability (prior to the Convention, there was no arbitration body to decide disputes). A Declaration made in 1874 at Brussels by Great Britain, France, Germany and twelve other powers of Europe had proscribed pillage and the confiscation of artworks. A similar principle was echoed by the Institute of International Law in its Oxford Manualof 1880, which would serve as a guide to troops on the ground. While neither were strictly binding, they indicated a custom crystalising with regard to the protection of cultural objects during times of war.
However, the custom was unfortunately not universal. It sadly stopped at Europe’s borders. When it came to colonising the so-called ‘Dark Continent’, all bets were off.
The problem with trying to find a similar custom in the way the European powers dealt with Africa is that there were simply too many instances of looting and seizure still taking place. British troops took artefacts from Maqdala in 1868, from Ashanti in 1874 and, of course, from Benin in 1897, while French troops looted Ségou in 1890 and Abomey in 1892. The sine qua nonof a customary rule – a generalised state practice that forsook looting – was simply non-existent when it came to Africa, at least not until the twentieth century.
It is a cruel twist of fate that the pillage of Benin City, resulting in what was probably the greatest haul of African artwork in history, took place two years before the Hague Convention was signed. And it seems patently unfair that a principle which had been applied between European states more or less since 1815 was dead in the water when it came to Africa – or any other colonised territory for that matter.
But this explanation of the state of affairs shows us that, while the looting of African stores was not legallyforbidden at the time, the actions were nonetheless of questionable morality, even back then. To use the language of the 1880 Oxford Manual, it still violated the ‘principles of justice which guide the public conscience’.
Despite what some have written more recently, moral question marks were in place early on in the story. Not everyone at the time agreed with the less savoury actions taken on behalf of Empire. Following the Maqdala expedition by the British Army into Abyssinia, for example, Prime Minister Gladstone stated in Parliament that he ‘deeply regretted’ that the treasures had been taken, expressing sorrow that items so sacred to the Abyssinians ‘were thought fit to be brought away by the British army’. Upon the order of the British Government, with support from no less a figure than Queen Victoria, the holiest book which had been taken from Maqdala in 1868, the Kebra Nagast, was returned from the British Museum to Abyssinia four years after the expedition. It seems Victorian morality was not so different from our own.
Whether predicated by rule of law or ethical inclination, the principle against pillaging of cultural objects does not immediately lead to their return. Restitution of cultural property has always been a drawn-out affair. The University of Heidelberg in Germany saw its famous collection of books looted by the Bavarians in 1622 during the Thirty Years War; it would have to wait nearly 200 years to have them returned. In the twentieth century, the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 finally allowed France to recover flags, archives and artworks taken by Germany some 50 years earlier. More recently, Italy returned a Roman sculpture to Libya and a monumental obelisk to Ethiopia, both taken during Italy’s colonial ventures in Africa, nearly 100 and 70 years earlier respectively. But these things take time.
Nevertheless, once a new legal or ethical plane has been reached, it becomes possible for cultural objects to be returned. Past actions, even if undertaken legally for the time, can have present-day consequences. Of note is French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision last month to return 26 objects looted by French troops in Abomey in 1892, a seemingly analogous case to that of Benin City for the British. While the question remains what the legal basis for this return will be, often in these cases, shifts in morality predate shifts in law.
The unfortunate absence of any rule of international law in this particular instance means that the Benin Bronzes cannot be forced back to Nigeria, the country comprising the Benin Kingdom’s former territory. However, the compelling moral factors described above do beg for a reasonable outcome. Such an outcome would, in my mind, provide that part of that great collection be made available to scholars, researchers, curators and the general public of West Africa for a significant period of time, perhaps on a rotating basis, by way of a long-term loan. This does not mean permanent restitution, which can be left for a later date, provided the temporary return proves secure, fruitful and sustainable.
Offering meaningful access to communities of origin, as is envisioned by the Benin Dialogue Group in its most recent arrangements, does represent a reasonable first step. Having some of the items back in Benin City will hopefully allow a local audience to appreciate once again the artistry that went into creating and casting them. On the other side of the coin, sending the pieces out on a long-term loan can help prove to the British Museum and other Western institutions that even without these pieces in their possession, the walls won’t come tumbling down.

375,The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes ... - Amazon UK,https://www.amazon.co.uk/Brutish-Museums-Colonial-Violence-Restitution/dp/0745341764,"The centre-piece, the prize exhibit of the book is the capture of the city of Benin by British forces in February 1897, and the subsequent looting of the celebrated Benin bronzes and their dispersal to museums and private collections. The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.",,2021-03-12,centre piece prize exhibit book capture city benin british force february 1897 subsequent loot celebrate benin bronze dispersal museum private collection attack benin

Germany ponders return of looted colonial bronzes to Nigeria
By AFP Published: Mar 25, 2021 06:58 PM
Germany is considering handing back a set of precious artifacts known as the Benin bronzes to Nigeria, a committee said Wednesday as a global debate gathers pace over the restitution of ancient artworks.
Members of the committee at the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK), which manages Berlin's museums, have ""agreed to find a solution in the case of the Benin bronzes that also considers the restitution of objects as an option,"" it said in a statement.
The metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin between the 16th and 18th centuries are now scattered around European museums, after being looted by the British at the end of the 19th century.
The SPK's Ethnological Museum has 530 historical objects from the kingdom, including 440 bronzes - considered the most important collection outside London's British Museum.
Some 180 of the bronzes - which are not from modern Benin but the ancient Kingdom of Benin, today part of southern Nigeria - are due to be exhibited in 2021 in Berlin's Humboldt Forum, a new museum complex that opened in December 2020.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Wednesday that the country was ""working with those involved in Nigeria and in Germany"" on the future of the objects, which he called ""a question of justice.""
""An honest approach to colonial history also includes the question of restitution of cultural assets,"" he said.
Ahead of the forum's opening in December 2020, the Nigerian ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar, called for the bronzes to be returned.
The Prussian Heritage Foundation has previously said it was mulling repatriation of the objects as an option, along with other solutions including sharing the works with museums in Nigeria.
Most former European colonial powers have begun a process in recent years of considering the return of looted artifacts to the former colonies, especially in Africa.
In March 2019, Germany launched a project aimed at ""identifying works from the colonial context whose appropriation took place in a manner contrary to the law or ethically unjustifiable,"" according to the foreign ministry.",,2021-03-25,artsculture leisure germany ponders return loot colonial bronze nigeria afp publish mar 25 2021 0658 germany consider hand back set precious artifact know benin bronze nigeria committee say wednesday global debate gather pace restitution ancient artwork member committee prussian cultural heritage foundation spk manages berlin museum agree find solution case benin bronze also considers restitution object option say statement metal plaque sculpture decorate royal palace kingdom benin 16th 18th century scatter around european museum loot british end 19th century spks ethnological museum 530 historical object kingdom include 440 bronze consider important collection outside london british museum 180 bronze modern benin ancient kingdom benin today part southern nigeria due exhibit 2021 berlin humboldt forum new museum complex open december 2020 german foreign minister heiko maas say wednesday country work involve nigeria germany future object call a question justice an honest approach colonial history also include question restitution cultural asset say ahead forum opening december 2020 nigerian ambassador germany yusuf tuggar call bronze return prussian heritage foundation previously say mull repatriation object option along solution include share work museum nigeria former european colonial power begin process recent year consider return loot artifact former colony especially africa march 2019 germany launch project aim identify work colonial context whose appropriation take place manner contrary law ethically unjustifiable accord foreign ministry,artscultur leisur germani ponder return loot coloni bronz nigeria afp publish mar 25 2021 0658 germani consid hand back set preciou artifact known benin bronz nigeria committe said wednesday global debat gather pace restitut ancient artwork member committe prussian cultur heritag foundat spk manag berlin museum agre find solut case benin bronz also consid restitut object option said statement metal plaqu sculptur decor royal palac kingdom benin 16th 18th centuri scatter around european museum loot british end 19th centuri spk ethnolog museum 530 histor object kingdom includ 440 bronz consid import collect outsid london british museum 180 bronz modern benin ancient kingdom benin today part southern nigeria due exhibit 2021 berlin humboldt forum new museum complex open decemb 2020 german foreign minist heiko maa said wednesday countri work involv nigeria germani futur object call a question justic an honest approach coloni histori also includ question restitut cultur asset said ahead forum open decemb 2020 nigerian ambassador germani yusuf tuggar call bronz return prussian heritag foundat previous said mull repatri object option along solut includ share work museum nigeria former european coloni power begun process recent year consid return loot artifact former coloni especi africa march 2019 germani launch project aim identifi work coloni context whose appropri took place manner contrari law ethic unjustifi accord foreign ministri

Institutions from Europe and Nigeria are cooperating in a project to exhibit the Benin Bronzes in their place of origin. European museums will loan these looted objects in their collections to a new to be built museum in Benin City. A journey to the scene of the crime shows the difficulties involved in the debate on restitution. Still, restitution should be the goal.
My trip to Nigeria in May and June 2019 started with a text-box I wrote for an interview with the Dutch expert on looted art Jos van Beurden about his PhD research, published in this newspaper in 2017. His message in the headline went: “Museums, return the stolen art”. As an editor I was looking for some appealing examples to include: the friezes of the Parthenon in London, the bust of Nefertiti in Berlin, the Benin Bronzes. The Bronzes - they seemed familiar, but what and how exactly?
Scattered
This resulted in a blurb of some 90 words: “No collection of art treasures is scattered around the world like the ‘Benin Bronzes’. The bronze plaques and statues of kings, nobles and warriors stood in the palace of the Benin Kingdom (in current day Nigeria). This treasure trove was looted by British soldiers during a punitive e expedition in 1897. Estimates of the size of the collection range from 2400 to 4000 pieces, which found their way to museums in London, Oxford, Glasgow, Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Dresden, Leipzig, Stuttgart, Munich, Mannheim, Vienna, Paris, St Petersburg, New York, Washington, Boston, Chicago and Leiden.”
Having been in Nigeria in 1993 to report on the presidential elections, I never thought I would find an incentive to return. On Election Day, June 12, I arrived at a polling station early in the morning and was immediately apprehended by two gentlemen. I had been detained all day, and could not do my reporting. “Well sir, the results of the elections will be in all newspapers tomorrow,” a cop hissed. This turned out not to be true. The opposition candidate won, so the incumbent President Babangida declared the vote invalid.
Democracy
What a coincidence then that during my stay last month, June 12 was proclaimed National Day of Democracy. Apparently although the result had been canceled the polls had never been as fair as on that day in 1993. The current government of President Buhari had now decided that that achievement should be celebrated.
Buhari’s current regime is the umpteenth government since 1993, and gives the population as little valid reason to celebrate as his colleagues since Babangida. Although oil-rich Nigeria is no longer a dictatorship, 94 million people - almost half the population - live below the poverty line. And that number is growing. Most Nigerians don’t have access to healthcare, around 40 percent is illiterate. Boko Haram terrorizes parts of the country and the government is among the world’s most corrupt; media report regularly on politicians and civil servants who amass millions.
In 1993, I met with lots of kind people, and heroes such as human rights activist Beko Ransome Kuti. But what stuck with me most was all the violence, and the sense of hopelessness: I decided I would never return to Nigeria if I didn’t have to. And yet, a couple of months ago I found myself eager to take that trip for a second time.
What had changed? While writing that initial text-box I had felt embarrassed that I, Africa editor from 1989 to 1996, didn’t know anything about the Benin Kingdom and its royal dynasty, which reaches back to the 13th century. When I started reading about this wealth of history I was sold. Such a versatile, intriguing story!
One of the first people to write about the Benin Kingdom was a Dutchman. Olfert Dapper, a writer from the 17th century, based his stories on second-hand information, as he had never been there himself. “The King’s court is square, and as large as the city of Haarlem,” he wrote in 1668 with a Dutch gaze. “It is divided into many beautiful palaces, houses and rooms of the courtiers, with beautiful, long square galleries, about the size of the stock exchange in Amsterdam. The pillars in the palace are covered with cast copper from top to bottom, with images of their wars and battles.”
‘Free trade’
So this is what the palace, which was actually a small town with the residences of court officials, looked like in the heyday of the Benin Kingdom. At the end of the 19th century that Kingdom was already in decay. The British colonial authorities had signed a “free trade agreement” with the then Oba (king) Ovonramwen. But they were dissatisfied with compliance to the treaty. In 1897, James Phillips, consul general of the Niger Coast Protectorate, went to the Kingdom to demand obedience. At the border of Benin City he was told that the Oba could not receive him due to royal obligations.
Phillips couldn’t care less. He probably wanted to provoke a war. “I have reason to believe that we will find enough ivory in the king’s house to cover the costs of removing the king from his seat,” he had written before he went. But he never saw the spoils of his war. He was shot on his way to the palace.
Revenge
A month after that incident, the British had mobilized a military force for a revenge expedition. They stormed Benin City and burned down the palace. They took with them thousands of bronze objects, and ivory and wood carvings. Many of these pieces were taken from altars, as they had been used for centuries by the dynasty of Oba’s to communicate with their ancestors and gods. The ‘curiosities’ were shipped to cities all over the world; 139 of the artefacts ended up in the current Museum of Ethnology (Museum van Volkenkunde) in Leiden, the Netherlands.
The bronzes - which made up the bulk of the loot - soon caused a sensation in Europe. The fact that African ‘savages’ were able to produce such high standard objects was met with disbelief: people were willing to believe that the bronzes could be of Egyptian, Indian, Turkish or Mexican origin, but African?
Less disputed at the time was the conception that the people of the Benin Kingdom, the Bini, were indeed ‘savages’. A few weeks after the battle, the London Review reported on the expedition, and made sure to include sections on the “hideous rites to their gods or fetishes” the Bini practiced: “The most savage, horrible and bloodthirsty customs that even Africa can show.” Drawings showed decaying bodies of sacrificed slaves, splayed out on crunchy fields and crucified on trees. As the article stated “Human sacrifices were scattered everywhere.”
Cruel
Sure, the Bini had some cruel practices. They sacrificed slaves. Also certain priests, who were believed to embody the limbs of the Oba, were offered when the king died. In the complex social system of the Benin Kingdom, enslaved people sometimes attained high positions in the army - and went on to enslave others. Despite this home-grown practice, the Bini would probably have enslaved and traded fewer people without the demand of European traders. And they would probably also have cast fewer bronzes without the metal that Europeans traded for slaves.
The Benin Kingdom’s success was partly based on its strict constitutional order, which included compulsory military service for men. The divine Oba, mediator between the earthly and the spiritual realm, and guardian of the cosmological order, was the head of state. The state council maintained checks and balances, between councils of court servants, village elders, guilds and priests. Women (apart from the mothers of Obas) were of little importance in the Kingdom: they could be given to the Oba as wives, or gifted by the him to the chiefs.
Restitution
What would be left of that culture from which those ‘bronzes’ were taken, I wondered? How do the Bini look at those bronzes and their culture in 2019?
In Europe, museums are increasingly struggling to address their colonial history and the looting that took place in that system. The debate about restitution has been going on for years, but it received a boost in 2017 when French President Macron spoke out in support of restitution of African cultural heritage (although he has not yet translated that promise into policy). The Dutch Museum of World Cultures, parent organization of the Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, initiated a restitution policy this year. Work is also being done on this in Germany institutions.
In the field of looted art the Benin Bronzes form a category in itself: so obviously stolen, so many pieces (several thousand), so scattered all over the world, so iconic. Another notable thing about the Bronzes is that last year authorities from Nigeria and ten European museums, including the Leiden Museum of Ethnology, signed an agreement: Nigeria will build a new museum in Benin City, and European museums will loan Bronzes from their collections to that museum.
Right: loan, not return.
The Nigerian institutions have stated in the agreement they will not abandon their claim for legal ownership of the Bronzes. But for that they will have to take a different route; restitution is often a matter for the state, which often owns the collections that museum authorities only manage.
National Museum
Another question that I wanted to address: a Nigerian museum, what should we imagine?
When I made it to Nigeria last month my first stop was clear: the National Museum in Lagos. I had read a lot of bad things about the space. You get through it quickly. The exhibition comprises of a few hundred objects, arranged according to obsolete ethnographical principles: people A, B or C used this or that object at birth, marriage or funeral. Zero connection with the outside world.
Amongst the collection there are also a few ‘Benin Bronzes’ - though their safety in the museum has not always been guaranteed. Illustrated by an incident in 1973, when the president of the time, General Yakubu Gowon, was scheduled to visit the British Queen Elizabeth and wanted to give her a copy of one of the heads. But when the copy turned out to be a disappointment, the General went to the National Museum and picked the original 16th century artefact from the display and gifted it to the Queen. Until 2002, when this story came to light supported by material research and witness statements, the British court had assumed it had received a copy.
Shopping center
Next to the National Museum, a newer building stands tall. It was built with government money as a repository for the museum collection. But before the project was finalized management of the building changed hands and it became a shopping center instead. Now much of the museum’s collection of cultural heritage objects still are supposed to be in the ragged barracks behind the museum. The storage space is not accessible, but you pass it en route to the library which is housed in a similar barrack. A few hundred seemingly random titles are on the shelfs, such as ‘The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mushrooms’, which could come in handy in the stuffy space where water has leaked into the hallway.
“The National Museum had more than 500,000 objects when it was founded,” says Kolawole Oseni, director of the Lagos State Records & Archives Bureau. But many of those objects were stolen, or disappeared when they were lent to museums elsewhere in the country. “We don’t know where they are.”
In 2008, Oseni wrote recommendations for the Minister of Culture to improve the organization of federal museums. But his report disappeared into the drawers of the minister and the responsible museum authority of all federal museums, the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).
NCMM
The NCMM, led by a director with ministerial status, is also an important authority for the process of restitution of the Bronzes. The NCMM is a key player in the Benin Dialogue Group, in which negotiations between Nigerian authorities and European museums took place, which resulted in the agreement on the new museum in Benin City.
The NCMM is also responsible for the existing Benin National Museum in Benin City, which houses a few of the Bronzes. The Benin National Museum has an equally bad reputation as many of the other museums run by the Commission, but has been fixed up a little since the new director (see interview with Theophilus Umogbai) entered into a collaboration with the Smithsonian Museum in Washington. However the museum still attracts few visitors, and essential infrastructure such as a dehumidification system is missing.
Generally speaking Nigerian museums are oddities, ufo’s that do little to attract visitors. This isn’t helped by the fact that large parts of the population can’t afford a ticket, and even that many have an aversion for what they consider ‘demonic’ art housed in museums. This disconnection between museums and their intended audiences is also a consequence of the fact that history as a subject was missing at secondary school curriculums for years. Sometimes groups of students do come to the Benin National Museum, but there are no special facilities to receive them.
Consciousness
In Benin City, the second stop of my journey, a strong national consciousness is obvious: you can see references to the Bronzes in garden statues and graffiti. Oba Ewuare II, the fortieth of his dynasty, is held in high esteem. He is at the head of the traditional system of administration, which functions alongside the elected government. To all accounts the Oba and the popular state governor, Godwin Obaseki, govern in harmony. And the city is still home to a guild of bronze founders who produce art objects and souvenirs, though no longer exclusively for the Oba.
What I wanted to know: what do people directly involved - such as bronze founders, historians, artists and traditional leaders – think about the arrangement by which European museums loan the Bronzes back to Benin City, instead of actually returning them?
Bad idea
As you would expect, the majority of people I spoke to felt that those objects should be returned unconditionally, because they were stolen. However many of them stressed that if it ever actually comes to restitution, it would be a very bad idea to return them to the federal government or the NCMM: fat chance the Bronzes will disappear, they said, so instead please give them to the state or to the Oba, where they would be safe.
There is a lot to be said for that. But a thorny issue arises if Nigeria invokes the rules for restitution of the Dutch Museum of World Cultures. When it comes down to the Nigerian federal government, will the Minister of Culture, who ultimately has to approve any restitution, be in favor of handing over to local governments? The restitution provisions leave room for this, but would the Dutch government (or eventually those of other states involved) face up to confrontation?
I would say: take that stand. Admittedly, the safety of the objects even in the Oba’s palace is not as undisputed as the general conception has it. For example in 1818 an Oba set himself and the palace on fire as a competing pretender to the throne approached with an army. Much of the ivory the British were hoping for in 1897 was then lost; fortunately bronze is more fireproof. And in 1976 a burglar stole many pieces from the palace - everything was recovered, but still.
What if
One might ask other questions regarding safety of objects to be returned. What if the now warm relationship between the state and the Oba turns sour and ends up in a fight over the objects? What if the traditional Obas and chiefs have to make way, for instance under the influence of Christian fundamentalists? What if the Islamist Boko Haram assaults this ‘pagan’ art? What if a new kleptocrat turns his attention to the treasures?
Well, if things like that happen we can do very little against it. ‘Museums, return the stolen art’ was the headline above the interview that I provided with a textbox in 2017. To me that still seems to be a good starting point.
Recognize that we have these pieces in our collection thanks to a raid that amounted to cultural genocide. Recognize that they are so much more important there than they would ever be here. Transfer ownership. Ask for objects to be loaned to European museums – there is a willingness on the Nigerian side. Pay royalties for those loans. Help Nigerians who can make their museum a success, there are some good candidates among the people I interviewed. Return the Benin Bronzes in the end – no, not all at once, and don’t rush into anything.",,2019-07-19,essay bring home loot benin bronze institution europe nigeria cooperate project exhibit benin

1079,Alarm over criminalisation of Benin Bronze protester - Lexology,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2b973195-44a7-4234-afe8-9550d027a2ff,"Restitution campaigners have expressed alarm over the conviction of a man who staged a protest at the Museum of London in January 2020.
33-year-old Isaiah Ogundele took part in a demonstration at the Museum’s permanent ‘London, Sugar & Slavery’ gallery on 29 January 2020. The gallery explores London’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and contains two original Benin bronzes on long-term loan from the British Museum: a water container (1500s) and a brass plaque (1500s-1600s).
The ‘Benin Bronzes’ in the British Museum’s collection are a group of sculptures created from at least the 16th century onwards in the West African Kingdom of Benin by specialist guilds working for the royal court of the Oba (king) in Benin City. In 1897, British troops invaded Benin City and plundered the royal palace and other ceremonial sites. No systematic record was made of the looted objects, which were then distributed and sold across the world.
Ogundele protested at the Museum of London to call for the restitution of the Benin Bronzes to their country of origin. According to a spokeswoman for the Museum of London, Ogundele “became increasingly concerned about the objects on display”. He is reported to have knocked over several sculptures from their plinths in a bid to seize them and shouted at members of Museum of London staff. Police were called and Ogundele was arrested.
On 18 September, Stratford Magistrates’ Court convicted him in absentia after Ogundele failed to appear at court. According to The Art Newspaper, Ogundele, who has no fixed abode, may have been unaware of the date for the court hearing. He was found guilty of “threatening/abusive/insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm, or distress”. The offence may require Ogundele to serve a prison sentence of up to six months, a fine or both.
The incident marks the first time a UK museum has been involved in the criminalisation of a protest about the repatriation of African cultural heritage.
Campaigners for the restitution of stolen African artefacts and human remains in UK museums and cultural institutions reacted strongly to Ogundele’s arrest and conviction. Executive director of AFFORD (African Foundation for Development), Onyekachi Wambu, who attended the 18 September hearing, said “Judging by the evidence given in court, what the young man needed was additional support to help with his welfare, not criminalisation”.
“Attempts to criminalise those participating in these campaigns should be avoided at all costs, not least when we consider the initial violent and murderous circumstances in which these collections were acquired. Criminalising the descendants of those original victims intensifies the original crimes”, Wambu added.
Director of arts and education charity Culture&, Errol Francis, expressed similar concerns. “While I would not support the damage of artefacts, I am concerned about what appears to be a criminalisation of protest in this case”, Francis said.

Met Museum Announces Return of Two Benin Bronzes to Nigeria
The museum, which has some 160 items from Benin City, becomes the latest institution to announce the restitution of some of the priceless artifacts.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced on Wednesday that it planned to return two brass plaques from its collection, part of the group of West African artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes, to Nigeria, making it the latest institution to pursue repatriation of the looted works.
It has also brokered the return of a third object — a brass head produced in the city of Ife around the 14th century — that had been offered to the museum for sale.
“The Met is pleased to have initiated the return of these works and is committed to transparency and the responsible collecting of cultural property,” the museum said in a statement.
The two 16th-century brass plaques, “Warrior Chief” and “Junior Court Official,” were created at the Court of Benin.
They are part of a collection of artifacts that the British army looted in an 1897 raid on Benin City, in what is now Nigeria, that are now scattered through museums and private collections around the world.
The plaques were housed in the British Museum and then the National Museum in Lagos. “Although they were never deaccessioned by the National Museum,” the Met said in a statement, “the two plaques entered the international art market at an unknown date and under unclear circumstances and were eventually acquired by a New York collector.”
In 1991, the collector gave his Benin works to the Met.
The Met, which has some 160 items from Benin City, including a renowned ivory mask, in its collection, said it initiated the return after conducting research in partnership with the British Museum over the past year. The works in the Met’s collection “were largely given to the institution in the 1970s and 1990s by individuals who acquired them on the art market,” a spokesman told The New York Times in April.
Kenneth Weine, a spokesman for the Met, said the mask was not being considered for return, though he did not provide a reason.
The Met has deaccessioned the plaques and will deliver them to the director general of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Abba Isa Tijani, when he is able to travel to New York City, the museum said in a statement.
They will likely be displayed in the planned Edo Museum of West African Art in Benin City, which is being designed by the architect David Adjaye. The museum’s current target is to open in 2025, though the timeline has been pushed back several times.
Despite their name, many of the bronzes are actually made from ivory, brass and wood. While Europe’s museums have had discussions with Nigeria for years, American institutions have only recently begun to act on the bronzes in their collections.
“Nigeria enjoins other museums to take a cue from this,” Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the minister of information and culture of Nigeria, said in a statement. “The art world can be a better place if every possessor of cultural artifacts considers the rights and feelings of the dispossessed.”",,2021-06-09,advertisement support met museum announces return two benin bronze nigeria museum 160 item benin city becomes late institution announce restitution priceless artifact metropolitan museum art announce wednesday plan return two brass plaque collection part group west african artifact know benin bronze nigeria make late institution pursue repatriation loot work also broker return third object — brass head produce city ife around 14th century — offer museum sale the met pleased initiate return work commit transparency responsible collect cultural property museum say statement two 16th century brass plaque warrior chief junior court official create court benin part collection artifact british army loot 1897 raid benin city nigeria scatter museum private collection around world plaque house british museum national museum lagos although never deaccession national museum met say statement the two plaque enter international art market unknown date unclear circumstance eventually acquire new york collector 1991 collector give benin work met met 160 item benin city include renowned ivory mask collection say initiate return conduct research partnership british museum past year work mets collection be largely give institution 1970s 1990s individual acquire art market spokesman told new york time april kenneth weine spokesman met say mask consider return though provide reason met deaccession plaque deliver director general nigeria national commission museum monument abba isa tijani able travel new york city museum say statement likely displayed plan edo museum west african art benin city design architect david adjaye museum current target open 2025 though timeline push back several time despite name many bronze actually make ivory brass wood europe museum discussion nigeria year american institution recently begin act bronze collection nigeria enjoins museum take cue this alhaji lai mohammed minister information culture nigeria say statement the art world well place every possessor cultural artifact considers right feeling dispossess,advertis support met museum announc return two benin bronz nigeria museum 160 item benin citi becom latest institut announc restitut priceless artifact metropolitan museum art announc wednesday plan return two brass plaqu collect part group west african artifact known benin bronz nigeria make latest institut pursu repatri loot work also broker return third object — brass head produc citi ife around 14th centuri — offer museum sale the met pleas initi return work commit transpar respons collect cultur properti museum said statement two 16th centuri brass plaqu warrior chief junior court offici creat court benin part collect artifact british armi loot 1897 raid benin citi nigeria scatter museum privat collect around world plaqu hous british museum nation museum lago although never deaccess nation museum met said statement the two plaqu enter intern art market unknown date unclear circumst eventu acquir new york collector 1991 collector gave benin work met met 160 item benin citi includ renown ivori mask collect said initi return conduct research partnership british museum past year work met collect were larg given institut 1970 1990 individu acquir art market spokesman told new york time april kenneth wein spokesman met said mask consid return though provid reason met deaccess plaqu deliv director gener nigeria nation commiss museum monument abba isa tijani abl travel new york citi museum said statement like display plan edo museum west african art benin citi design architect david adjay museum current target open 2025 though timelin push back sever time despit name mani bronz actual made ivori brass wood europ museum discuss nigeria year american institut recent begun act bronz collect nigeria enjoin museum take cue thi alhaji lai moham minist inform cultur nigeria said statement the art world better place everi possessor cultur artifact consid right feel dispossess
1135,Review: 'Loot' Tells of the Benin Bronzes from an African ...,https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/loot-barnaby-phillips-review-benin-bronzes-1234591506/,"In 1974, the Nigerian government asked the British Museum to loan back an object that had been looted from the country more than seven decades earlier. That object, an ivory mask that once belonged to royalty in the Kingdom of Benin, depicts Idia, a queen active during the 16th century, and though it is cracked in parts, it retains its nearly unparalleled beauty. On its website, the British Museum calls the work “among the most enduring and emotive examples of the representation of women in Benin court art.”
“It’s a small thing, only twenty-three centimeters long, but I can’t look at it without feeling moved,” writes Barnaby Phillips in his new book Loot: Britain and the Benin Bronzes (Oneworld Publications), a deep dive into the story of the Benin Bronzes. “The queen’s eyes are dark, inset with iron pupils and lids of bronze, making a lovely contrast with the aged ivory. She has a haunting feminine beauty.”
It made sense that Nigerians wanted the mask to act as a mascot for a festival known as FESTAC ’77, a celebration of the continent’s culture. But for that to happen, Nigerian officials were going to have to free her from “prison,” as Erhabor Emokpae, the Edo artist who lobbied the government to get the loan, once put it. With pan-Africanism finding favor around the world, the Nigerian government hoped that the political moment would enable the country get back one of its lost cultural treasures, if only temporarily.
It turned out that their optimism was misplaced: the British Museum rejected their plea “on conservation grounds,” claiming that the humidity in Nigeria would damage the work. In other words, the climate in which the mask was originally made would, in the eyes of the British, prove too hostile for it. Nigeria’s Daily Times called the quagmire a “tragi-comedy.” In a fittingly dark conclusion, despite the protests of Africans living in London, the work never made it to Lagos. Today, it is still housed by the British Museum, which has owned it since 1910.
In recent years, there is a growing awareness among people living in the West that the Queen Idia mask and thousands of objects like it were looted. Taken by British soldiers in 1897, these works, collectively known as the Benin Bronzes (though many are also crafted from ivory and brass), are held in institutions around the globe. Calls for their return are reaching a fever pitch, with Germany vowing last week to start sending back its Benin Bronzes next year. If these protests are relatively new among Europeans and Americans, they are old in Nigeria, where politicians, museum directors, artists, and local citizens have long pointed to the plundering of these works as a sign of colonialism’s long-term impacts on the region.
[What are the Benin Bronzes, and why are they important?]
“We shouldn’t have to ask, over and over, to get back what is ours,” Edo artist Victor Ehikhamenor tells Phillips in Loot, which focuses on how the cache of artifacts was stolen by the British and subsequently dispersed. The story Phillips tells is one we’ve heard before, most recently in curator Dan Hicks’s 2020 book The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution. But rarely have books like Loot focused so in-depth on the perspectives of Africans. As Loot makes clear, whether in the form of Nollywood films or oral histories handed down across generations, Nigerians have had a lot to say about the Benin Bronzes.
In 1897, British officers looted tusks from the Kingdom of Benin. Key among Phillips’s achievements is his ability to show the pain that the plundering of the Benin Bronzes continues to cause. It’s something the author understands personally. He was born in Kenya in 1968 and has worked as a BBC correspondent while posted in countries such as Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa. “I’ve lived much of my life in Africa,” he writes toward the end of his book, “and know how, in conversations and friendships, it is rare to feel truly free of the suffocating weight of colonialism.”
Phillips kicks off his stylish tome with an in-depth history of the Kingdom of Benin, which now forms much of Nigeria’s current Edo State. One of Phillips’s few missteps comes early on, when he makes the mistake of starting that lineage by centering Europe, opening that section in 1486 with the first contact between Benin and Portuguese explorers. But Phillips quickly recovers by doing something most writers have not: he paints a touching portrait of the kingdom and the people who inhabited it.
We learn of how the kingdom’s power “waxes and wanes” between the 15th and 19th centuries, and we get a sense of the meaning of certain important rituals of the Edo people, including human sacrifice. Europeans used that rite to label Benin a kingdom that “stinks of death,” as British diplomat Richard Burton wrote upon his arrival in 1862. Refusing to only rely on European accounts of the era, Phillips also introduces contemporary Nigerian histories, which suggest that human sacrifice was intended to “bring good fortune to the community, to ensure success in warfare, to demonstrate the authority of the royal family and to drive out evil force.”
Phillips’s account of the fateful British-led 1897 mission that led to the looting of the Benin Bronzes likewise pays mind to the words of Nigerians. He tells of how the explorer James Phillips (no relation to the author of Loot) was warned not to visit and how he did so anyway, ultimately leading to his death at the hands of senior chiefs. There is a sense of tragedy about all this: Prince Edun Akenzua, the great-grandson of the kingdom’s ruler at the time, Oba Ovonramwen, calls the event “the day we lost our independence.”
The subsequent events are now well-known. The British pillaged the kingdom, plundered its goods, set it aflame, and later killed its high-ranking members, including the Oba. It is easy to lapse into ire while writing of these events. Phillips does not. He attempts as much as possible to remain a neutral interlocutor, offering evidence that, contrary to popular belief, the picture of the raid on the Kingdom of Benin may be more complicated than it initially seems. According to Phillips, several accounts of the plundering suggest that many victims met their death through human sacrifice, not at the hands of the British. Then there is the issue of the flames—Phillips writes that there is “strong evidence that the great fire of Benin was accidental,” although many Edo people believe otherwise. He describes it as “difficult” to discuss as much with many Nigerians even today.
When the Benin Bronzes came to Europe, they were seen “not as objects of religion, but as objects of art,” per Phillips—aesthetic inspiration, in other words, for modernists like Franz Marc and André Derain, the latter of whom at one point even owned a sculpture from the cache. As some objects headed to luxe presentations at the British Museum and elsewhere, others headed to auction, where they netted top prices. To some degree, the Benin Bronzes continue to attract attention when they are offered for sale. The current public record for a Benin Bronze at auction was set in 2007 with the sale of a sculpture of an Oba at Sotheby’s. Deaccessioned by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, it sold for $4.74 million. When private sales are taken into account, the record is even higher. According to Loot, one work known as the Ohly Head sold for $10 million.
In one thrilling stretch, Phillips attempts to plumb the psychologies of Europeans who still own Benin Bronzes. He describes a visit to the London home of a collector who has requested anonymity. From her father, she has inherited sculptures of the Oro bird, which played a crucial role in a 1515 battle; she calls the pieces “family heirlooms.” Has she thought of giving them back? “I don’t feel like giving them anything,” she says. “It’s not secure.” When Phillips leaves her, she’s still holding on to her bird sculptures, as if out of fear that she’ll lose them.
Gradually, however, Europeans are releasing their grasp on the Benin Bronzes—and it’s possible that a book like Loot could offer some readers the context needed to get behind Phillips’s cause.
When these objects are sent back, many will go to the brand-new Edo Museum of West African Art in Benin City, Nigeria. There have been previous attempts to build institutions worthy of holding the Benin Bronzes, however. In 1957, the British-born Kenneth Murray inaugurated the National Museum in Lagos, effectively laying the groundwork for an institutional network in the country. By 1960, as many as 30,000 people a day might come to the museum. But now, the National Museum has fallen into disrepair—Phillips writes that, on a recent visit, the grounds were strewn with trash, and the only other people in its galleries were a visiting school group. As Phillips tells it, institutions in the country are forced to fend off threats of theft, and too-small staffs must deal with disorganization and limited resources.
Murray’s legacy is one of “colonial museums that lacked indigenous roots but sought to imitate those of the mother country, and which have now withered and all but died,” Phillips writes, and this accounts for their failure. For that reason, EMOWAA could be a game-changer when it opens in 2025. With a building designed by visionary architect David Adjaye, EMOWAA will bear out connections to various members of the local community. It will be an institution for West Africans by West Africans. As artist Enotie Ogbebor tells Phillips, “Now more than ever, we need these works to come so that our people can behold them.”",,2021-05-03,1974 nigerian government ask british museum loan back object

1173,The week in art news – staff accuse Barbican Centre of being ...,https://www.apollo-magazine.com/art-news-barbican-centre-staff-institutional-racism/,"Current and former staff at the Barbican Centre in London have published an account of alleged incidents of discrimination, ‘written anonymously by […] employees who have experienced racism’, ranging from interactions with other, often more senior members of staff to abuse from members of the public. Copies of the book, titled Barbican Stories, have been sent to the institution’s directors, heads of departments and some members of its board. A Barbican spokesperson has said, ‘We are shocked and saddened to hear about these allegations, and will immediately launch an independent review into them.’
The Metropolitan Museum of Art will return two Benin Bronzes from its collection and is brokering the return of a third that had been offered to the Met in a private sale. The two works at the Met, a pair of brass plaques from the 16th century, were among those looted by British soldiers from Benin City in 1897 before entering the British Museum’s collection. They were transferred to the National Museum in Lagos in the 1950s; they then entered the international art market – before being donated to the Met in 1999 – in what the Met has described as ‘unclear circumstances’. The third object is a 14th-century brass Ife head; it will join the two plaques in the Nigerian National Collections.
Last Friday a fire broke out at Donald Judd’s former architecture office in Marfa, lasting more than 12 hours and severely damaging the site. The two-storey brick building had been undergoing works as part of the wider Marfa Restoration Plan, a project initiated by the Judd Foundation in 2018 to preserve and expand public access to the minimalist artist’s buildings in Marfa. Due to the renovation, which was set to be completed by early July, the office was empty at the time of the fire and there we no injuries or damaged artworks or artefacts.

1178,Columbia University Italian Academy: The Benin Bronzes ...,https://medren.columbia.edu/news/columbia-university-italian-academy-benin-bronzes-towards-resolution-long-standing-dispute,"The Benin Bronzes were looted in 1897 from the Royal Palace of Benin City during a punitive expedition amid the British colonial expansion into West Africa. Their status is now central to the worldwide discussion about restitution claims and the return of cultural objects to their place of origin. At stake is what will become of these thousands of pieces from the Benin court, the most famous of which are cast metal heads and commemorative plaques.
Featuring speakers from Africa, Europe, and the U.S., this conference addresses Nigeria’s claims and the preparations for the physical return of the Bronzes, outlines collaborative international projects, and looks at alternatives to restitution such as those proposed by institutions in Europe and elsewhere. Speakers (including some from the Benin Dialogue Group, which gathers Nigerian authorities and global museum delegates) will focus on key issues in critical heritage studies such as the decolonization of Western museums; the role of digitization; decontextualization; and the essential relationship between local communities and objects from their past.

1400,"The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence ...",https://www.amazon.ca/Brutish-Museums-Colonial-Violence-Restitution-ebook/dp/B08L5CLGSW,"The centre-piece, the prize exhibit of the book is the capture of the city of Benin by British forces in February 1897, and the subsequent looting of the celebrated Benin bronzes and their dispersal to museums and private collections. The attack on Benin was in retaliation for the massacre the previous month of an unarmed party of nine British officials and 240 of their carriers by Benin soldiers. (The carriers had no weapons, and the revolvers of the officials were stowed away in the baggage.) The British party were expecting to be turned back before reaching Benin, but were in fact lured into an ambush by the King of Benin’s emissaries, and only Capt. Boisragon and District Commissioner Locke, together with a few dozen carriers, managed to escape. In response to this a punitive expedition was mounted in February, which successfully captured the large city of Benin. The King and the rest of the inhabitants had fled, but the British found an appalling scene of human sacrifice, whose victims were Benin’s slaves and captives. There were a number of large pits in the “Ju-ju compounds” filled with bodies, and “Outside [the King’s house], in the open space, the state of things was almost more frightful than in the Juju compounds – everywhere sacrificial trees on which were the corpses of the latest victims – everywhere, on each path, were newly sacrificed corpses. On the principal sacrificial tree facing the main gate of the King’s Compound, there were two crucified bodies, at the foot of the tree seventeen newly decapitated bodies, and forty-three more in various stages of decomposition. On another tree a wretched woman was found crucified, while at its foot were four more decapitated bodies. To the west of the King’s house was a large open space, about 300 yards in length, simply covered with the remains of some hundreds of human sacrifices in all stages of decomposition. The same sights were met with all over the city. Such was the state of Benin City, well named the City of Blood, on the 18th February, 1897.” (The Benin Massacre, A.M.Boisragon, 1897, p.188.)
When Hicks refers to the Benin “atrocity” the naive reader might suppose that he is referring to these appalling sights, but not a bit of it: he is actually referring to the looting of the numerous Benin bronzes by the British force, and treats the descriptions of the original massacre of the unarmed mission, and of the sacrificial victims in Benin with ridicule and disbelief. According to Hicks, the “sensationalist” account in various books and the press “began with the supposed ‘massacre’ of nine British officials and traders” and “It continued from this ‘massacre’ to images of ‘ferocious cruelty’, ‘evil customs’...crucifixion trees, decapitated bodies, cannibalism, ‘ju-ju altars’ doused with human blood...”. Hicks, however, makes no attempt at all to investigate the veracity of these statements, and simply dismisses them all, without evidence, as “gothic schlock-horror” of the Dracula variety. Boisragon’s account of the slaughter revealed in Benin, which he compiled from the reports of British officers present at the time, is actually very restrained and unsensational. At the end of his book he says “I suppose some short description of the horrors of Benin City must be given, though they are almost too dreadful to be described”, and I have already quoted most of his description above, which is entirely credible. Benin had long been notorious for human sacrifice, and Sir Richard Burton (also ridiculed by Hicks) had visited it in 1862, and reported that the space in front of the King’s house was littered with skulls and other human bones. Hicks also manages to pass over almost without mention the fact that Benin, and the other kingdoms of West Africa, had always been slave-owning societies and had captured and sold the slaves needed by European slave-traders, and that the Benin “bronzes” were mostly cast from the brass that the Europeans had given in exchange for those slaves.
To sum up, then, the British who captured Benin had absolutely no reason to feel any respect for its culture, and in the circumstances the looting of the bronzes seems quite understandable.",,2021-03-12,centre piece prize exhibit book capture city benin british force february 1897 subsequent loot celebrate benin bronze dispersal museum private collection attack benin
